I've been writing code for the web in one form or another since before there were any books on it.  I'd head to one of the 300 or so pages Yahoo had at the time, save it, change something, reload, and squeal with delight at what I learned to do that day.  These days, it's a career, but the passion hasn't waned one bit.

I spent many years toiling away for up to 100 hours a week with my own company, trying to just keep the lights on and the team paid and neglecting my own growth.  In the past couple years, I've regained my focus and thirst for new knowledge and languages.  I joined this hackathon because I want to challenge myself and play with new APIs... and I've had this site idea in my head for a while that matches one of the themes perfectly.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I'm still fine-tuning my Javascript skills, but my long-time passion and strength is in PHP.  I've also been productive in Perl, Python, ASP and Java, and I'm getting my head around Node and Erlang.

I won't say much about the project and the APIs I plan to use as I feel it might give too much away, but I will say that I think it will be pretty far apart from what other teams will be doing.  You'll just have to wait and see.

Once upone a time craftsman decided to enter the best techical university of Ukraine. By that moment he didn't knew, that he would met with ecenomist, musician and anime guy. The only one thing that hade grouped this cvartet are AD&D. Past some weekends thay had figured out that thay had another one common interest - programming. This was the fate. Passion for programming and role-playingmade it's diel. And thay unite the team.

We had some problem. All of us knew nothing about design. And than we met last member of our team. It was a girl o_O.

This team do all it's best to make a critical hit. 1d20 FTW!

# 41 North Studios LLC

My name is Jim Armstrong, and I am the president of 41 North Studios LLC, a small web-design and programming agency
located in Norwalk, CT, USA.

This is my first hackathon and I have entered as a solo participant. I want to challenge myself and see if I can 
take a concept from idea to execution in 48 hours by myself. Above all, I'm hoping to have some fun, learn some 
new things, and be amazed at what everyone creates!

## My favorite languages

I mostly code in C#, Java, and Ruby. For this project I will likely default to Ruby since I am confortable with it 
and think my development time will be faster. However, depending on what I decide to build I may just try a language 
I'm not as familiar with to make this a good learning experience.

We are programmers working on our day jobs writing software,web apps, scripts,android apps et al. But there is something about
writing code that you really want to write, stuff that you try and build ( stuff that you dream off) in your free time.
This is what we would like to do, doing it in a time constraint environment, so as to have a minimum viable solution working
in quick time.

What are we going to do?

Theme: Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization. We love data and how to visualise it, we live in a world
where increasingly we are collecting data for various purposes, right from selling adverts to doing health research. This hack weekend
gives us a great opportunity to play with various APIs and build something useful off them.

Why are we participating?

This is our first hackathon per see. We just want to have a blast trying to do stuff , that we really would like to do. Period!


---------------------------------------

*720devs*

We're the founders of 720developments.com, as you can see in our webpage, we're a couple that is working with web developments together since we're just 21 years old (and dating since we're just 17). 7 years later since we starting on our own, we are still here, doing the same but in more interesting projects, trying to learn as much as we can in our free time, and trying to travel as much as we can with our budget.
Also we love to eat, drink good beer (we may start making our own next year) and walk long distances talking about, well, anything, with our 3 little dogs.

*What are we going to do?*

Theme: Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization.
We will focus in using an API to gather data about different problematics we're (as humanity) facing in this moment. 
We're going to try to do so in a simpler manner, so everyone can read clearly what's going on.

We choose that because we think that we are in the era of knowledge, because we have tons of data collected,
and every year more and more people is accessing to the internet.
Having companies focusing on getting objective data to show to the people instead of having just a few organizations 
deciding what information to show us, is a great step to get to a global agreement of how to manage our resources and
efforts to build a better and more equal world.

Also we think about learning tools, because we believe the future of education is in the web, but we prefer the
other theme better as we think they're already great tools out there that are doing very good right now.

*Why are we participating?*

Is the first time in a hackaton together, and the reasons are several, 
I'll enumerate the most important ones:
1. We have a bit more of time this year, and we think is a fun way to spend a weekend.
2. We think we're in a good moment as developers to do something great in just 2 days. 
3. We get surprised by the big amount of APIs out there with awesome information, and is a good excuse to play with them.
4. We will love to show our work to the great jury, having some chance to get to talk with some of them, is really the great prize of this competition.

we don't have time to join, we have a physics midterm on saturday and a never-ending history project that haunts us
and I suspect it will break the bonds of our friendships. so that's why we decided to join.

we all have it in our hearts to program something. we've all been this way when we met at the ORPHANAGE in Ankara,
we all studied very hard, putting aside coding, to go to university and just as when we were thinking we'll be having
a good time, we are doomed to do homework and all. 


we are incredibly skillful young fellows.

we're into applications.

APPetizers Put You in a Good Mood
================

We are the APPetizers. We build apps, in competitions!   Need we say more?  Probably! (and that's what the section below is for)


Our Dreams
===========================
It's our vision that apps be more than websites - we want to bring about real change with our code.

Our side project is something we believe could change everything political, EasyBallot.org.  We want to bring about political awareness in the US and other democratic countries.  I (Shawn) plan to dedicate all of my winnings to supporting the efforts of EasyBallot.org and help educate voters using their representative's previous voting history.

With time and enough data we can educate the public on gerrymandering, create political blacklists (to highlight the politicians that actually do not reprepresent their voters), and do so much more.

Our team is comprised of developers from National Instruments in Austin, TX.  

Skillz and Amazing Tools
=======
Half of our time at work is spent learning about new tools, and I believe the other half is probably coding.  So while we have a smorgasborg of info and tools in our repertoire, we tend to use what we believe is best for the job.

From our github accounts, we are all fairly well versed in javascript.

I know that with web app development, that's a bit like telling kids that we use snow for our snowmen, but our snowmen can file your taxes, walk the dog, and pick up the kids from daycare.  The rest is just good ideas and some guys having fun coding!

# Antonio

Hi! I'm an individual developer, excited to participate in the Hackathon.

## About Me

My name is Anton, you can also call me Antonio. I didn't think much about team name, it got to be just my name:).
I'm a PHP developer, also good in JavaScript. For backend I'm using PHP framework called Yii 2. This powerful thing 
leads PHP on completely different level.
And of course I like frontend too, so I got to be familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, especially jQuery, an 
awesome JavaScript library.

Looking forward when the koding battle begins... And let the strongest to win!

## Languages and tools I like

-- [Yii Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/) v2.0 (based on PHP)  
-- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (based on JavaScript)  
-- HTML 5, CSS 3  
-- DBMS: MySQL or [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.org/)  
-- [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) (honestly didn't use, but want to try (!) )  

-- and Java (I know it is completely different from PHP, but since I tried it, I really liked it. Although I'm not going 
to use it for the Hackathon, because don't have enough XP for that.)

## About my project

Most of all I want my project to be really useful for people. It is a primary purpose, because if it becomes useful, it is 
always possible to make it awesome.

# The Average Joes
We are a group of highschool friends who are all freshmen at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, this fall.
All four of us took introductory level programming courses this fall, and most of us aren't so experienced in any form of web development.
We see this as a unique challenge that will be very difficult for all of us.

## The Members
 - Luke Barwikowski: I have the most experience out of the group with web languanges, and that's the scary thing. I dabble in webdesign as a hobby, but see a future career in the backend parts of web applications. I will be leading this team, and hopefully I can teach these guys a thing or two and we'll make an awesome project.
 - Lyle Antieau: I admittedly am the worst person in this group. And I suck.
 - Nick Martinelli: I've taken a huge interest in programming lately. I don't really know much about anything, but I'm really excited for this.
 - Joseph Lafayette: Lyle sucks.
 
 ## Our Plan
 We plan on implementing the following frameworks, libraries, and languages
    -HTML5
    -jquery
    -Python
    -Flask
    -backbone.js


---------------------------------------

Axon
====

I am Daniel Masterson, a second year university student at the University of Hull (UK) currently studying MEng Computer Science With Games Development. I have been interested in programming since the age of 9 where I dove straight in (and straight back out again) to C++. My life has lead me through many languages - PHP, JavaScript, UnrealScript and my all time favourite C#. I'm here to show people what I can do with a free weekend and a lot of JavaScript.

Here's my face from that one time what I done did wear a suit to:
<img width="100" height="100" src='https://gravatar.com/avatar/95278064437320be49a4f68d742b9075?size=128' alt='Me'/>

## Why 'Axon'

Because it sounds cool and technical, and my other cool and technical names have been used recently for other things so I kind of had to fall back to this. Also, an axon is a core component of a neuron, so natually it means this project is intelligent, right?

## My Languages

Where to begin...
- C and C++
- C# (And a bit of Java)
- PHP
- JavaScript with JQuery
- UnrealScript (with the Unreal Development Kit)
- Visual Basic if the need arises
- A bunch of other things I've dabbled in like x86 Assembly, Python, Ruby and more esoteric languages. I even made a Befunge interpreter in HTML and JavaScript because...uh.

## What I will be doing in the project

Due to my almost annoyingly deep knowledge into the intricacies and quirks of JavaScript and JQuery, a large quantity of code will be written in that with either a raw HTML or Canvas front end (I once made a 3D Doom-like engine using CSS 3D transforms on div elements, so I'm not limited to going way out of bounds here!). I personally have not use many frameworks or libraries, but I'll definitely investigate whats on offer and see if it will help in my project.

About me
===========================

I'm full stack web developer from Ukraine with over 3 years of web development experience. I like that job very much. I didn't find a team for myself, so it's a solo, but I'll do my best to deliver really interesting application.

#### Languages I use:
- Ruby
- Javascript
- Go

#### Frameworks:
- Ruby on Rails
- Backbone.js
- and others...

There is nothing special to say about the application which will be built, however I'm going to use some great APIs to deliver new interesting solution for cross-language communicating.

Pierce Stegman

I am a junior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.  When I was 7, my dad bought me a book on HTML.  I started coding basic websites, and wanted to do more.  A few years later, my parents bought me Adobe CS4, and I began to make Flash games.  As I made games, I often asked myself how I could make games that helped people.  At first, I began to make educational games.  After a while, I decided I wanted to make things other than education games. As I looked into different things that I could make, I began to learn different languages.  In the process, I learned PHP, JavaScript, C++, C#, and recently HTML5.  I also took an interest in artificial intelligence.  Some examples of projects I made are a cryptocurrency exchange, an AI that learned to identify cyber bullying on Facebook, a system that lets one deploy code via email, and a GUI wallet for cryptonote currencies.

Fox Wilson

Hi, I'm also a junior at TJHSST. I've been playing with web development since I was 8, which led into other languages (I still remember when I wrote BASIC). Today, I'm skilled with Python, Ruby, JS and C. In the seven years between then and now, I've written numerous snippets, tools, and web apps, picked up GNU/Linux, participated in a number of competitions (1st place MITRE STEM CTF 2013, 2014, 3rd place BAH Data Science Bowl, 6th place PicoCTF 2014), went to hackathons (PilotPhilly, PilotDC, MHacks IV, Hack the North 2014), and learned a lot. I'm currently a student systems administrator at TJHSST, where I manage the systems behind our public-facing website, student intranet, and Linux lab. I look forward to (hopefully) participating in and learning from Koding's hackathon.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

Pierce Stegman

I am most skilled with backend development, artificial intelligence, and crytocurrencies.  We have an idea that will make use of AI to make reading the TOS and Terms and Conditions on a website not only fast, but easy and fun.

Fox Wilson

I'm good at backend, data visualization (Chart.JS, gnuplot, others), and systems administration. I'm not that bad at frontend development, and Pierce has already summed up what we'll be doing.


---------------------------------------

About your team
===========================

We have a junior coder and one not junior any more, and one with some experience.The whole team works with JavaScript, and we think we can do amazing things with JavaScript. We never worked all together on the same project, so this is going to be a challenge, but we're looking forward to it. 

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
The team lead is a Node.js developer and Node.js really does great in doing network requests and putting all the stuff together. The rest of the team also has Node.js experience, so we're going to pull in a lot of JavaScript.

The idea is to create a mesh of the existing public APIs and gather publicly available data and create a useful dashboard for displaying and manipulating this data. We want to pull in as much data as we can and then show it in an interesting way





---------------------------------------

Canik
================

This is my first hackathon and I have entered as a solo participant. 
I want a challenge. I want to create a software about a real world problem in 48 hours and I want to see what everybody else did.



My programming skills
=======
I am proficient in Java. I developed enterprise web applications with Primefaces. It is irrelevant in this event but I have 5 year experience with Android development.


I am planning to do something on Tomcat. I checked and it worked on koding.com vpn.

# Codeepy

We are a bunch of geeks who love to learn and master software development technologies. We are more than we are. We are ONE.

## About Us

- Abdush loves Java since he started to write his first code in this programming language. He formerly worked on several projects to provide software solutions with optimum algorithms in Sudan. He is regarded as expert by his friends due to his prominent experience in software and managerial skills. In his free time, you can find him talking with his friends or doing sport activities.
- Dommy has more than 5 years experience of professional software development in 2 different countries. He has been fallen in love with .NET since he learned how to write "Hello World!" program. Python - his second love - took his heart recently. In his spare time, Dommy enjoys watching football matches with his friends and arguing about some stupid things.
- Elchin was previously at ASPU, where he worked as an engineer-programmer. He was part of the Startup team working on the project called "Virtual Education System", which has been acquired by three large universities in Azerbaijan. In his spare time, Elchin likes playing chess and brainstorming with his friends.
- Halim loved Java before, but after years of playing with many different programming languages, he just doesn't have any tendency towards any specific programming language anymore. His greatest dream is to meet with a programming language or framework that can handle cross language problem. But what defines him most, Halim loves Manchester United. XD
- After his first programming class during his undergraduate studies, Somdip fell in love with coding and he never turned back since then. His one and only ambition is to help people through programming solutions. When he is not saving the world with coding, he can be found wandering the world to seek trouble and problems, whichever finds him first.

All of us have some work experience where we used different tools and we will combine them for this project.

We are thinking about doing something relevant to the real time communication/translation theme but nothing is decided yet.
We will use PHP, Javascript, Google Translate API, Bootstrap and lots of love...

I began doing freelance web development in high school, and had become disenchanted with it by the time I reached
University.  However, after working some co-op positions with some passionate web developers, I gained a appreciation
and insight for what the web is capable of.

Now, I'm all about pushing the limits of what the web can do.  I like to think I have some creative and innovative
ideas to bring to the table, and I'm excited to be taking part in the first ever Global Hackathon.  One day, when events
like this are commonplace, I'll be able to look back and say that I was there for the beginning!


Skills and Direction
=======

My passion has always been in interactive media, anything that takes entertainment beyond something to be simply
consumed, allowing people to influence and engage with it.  I love experimenting with new web technologies to
break expectations regarding the limitations of the web.  My hope is to combine my passion with these
technologies in a result that is both practical and delightful for users.

We are...Float-Center

We are skilled

Love Always,

Fluffle
================

Welcome to the Fluffle team page  :)


Team Fluffle (single person)
============================

Hello, my name is Kris and I'm a software engineer from Minneapolis, MN. 
Most of the work I've done in "the Industry"  has been data related ... 
data warehousing big data. Though I've worked in a variety of programming
languages, and have a deep understanding of data, I've rarely had the
opportunity to really explore front-end work and develop something really
slick that just begs to be used, clicked, played with.


Skills
=======
Data: Databases (Oracle, Informix, MySql), ETL: Ab Initio 

Programming: PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, C, C++

Plan
====
I've not yet picked my challenge, though I'll likely go with the HTML5 games 
challenge. Working through making a multiplayer, interactive, educational
experience would be an interestin challenge.

Tools I'd Use
=============
Not set in stone but I've been wanting to play with Phaser 2.0, so I'd likely 
start with that and add as necessary.





---------------------------------------

Flying Tarrasque
================

We are a team composed by two dudes who love to program and seek to make our mark in the world,

We are already working hard for some time on a project, 
this hackaton is the opportunity to gain money and the visibility we need to become this dream a reality .

It is also a good showcase for us to show how good we are at what we do .


Yes we have a lot of skills!
=======
We are good with nodejs , javascript , java and groovy , but we have a little weak to develop layouts.


The project
=======
We love Retrogames and we know how much we can learn while you play, so our project will follow this path, 
a great game to teach future great minds how to create great software.

We are self-taught developers that love to learn new things, especially things that matter in a social context. Our main goal has been to contribute to change the way we treat education in our culture. We share some feelings about formal education and how it should encourage students to care about the society when learning a profession instead to just getting certification. Innovation is something that needs to cover the way we relate to others.

Ivan
====
Front-end and back-end developer, started his journey into the software development at High School trying a little tricks with html and css by himself. Finished the underdegree in Control and Automation Engineering at IFG Brazil on august 2014. His projects in the college included developing a simple protocol in Python to comunicate traffic control devices and a web interface for users to see data. Recently started to delve into Rails, CSS and Javascript development.

Henrique
========
A passionate software engineer. Started his journey in development late (compared to others) when started his Computer Engineering course at UFG. Later he discovered he really loved that, so he decided to move to a Software Engineering at UFG to focus efforts on software development. Now still coursing, he is focusing his efforts on learning Agile Methodologies, TDD, BDD, Rails, Ruby, metaprogramming and everything related. Wants to make software that matters.

Although we are still in highschool, we have experience in programming and developing in many languages and platforms.
This is our first time at event like this, but we are ready and hopefully we can participate.

Theme: Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization. We will focus in using an API to gather data about different problematics we're (as humanity) facing in this moment. We're going to try to do so in a simpler manner, so everyone can read clearly what's going on.

We aim to build an utility that's going to be useful to millions of people every day, it could be used to warn from upcoming danger and even save people's lives.

<p align="center">

</p>

Hello, we are a team mostly from Japan (Tokyo), except for one of us, Fan, that I would like to call "Fan Fan". Our team name is called Gundam because we like ガンダム！Gundam/ガンダム is a Japanese giant robot mecha anime series and is very popular.

Although there is an explosion in the popularity of computer science in the United States and such, computer science and engineering is still looked down upon in Japan. Engineers are looked down upon in Japan. We want to change this mindset. If we win, we want to use this opportunity and make it so that all Japanese people will realize the power and potential of coding, computer science, and hackathons!

Fanさん以外、私たちは日本にいても、Fanさんも日本が好きです！アメリカなどでは情報工学はもっと大人気になるのに、日本ではまだ工学部は人気ではありません。私たちはその考えを変えたい。もし勝てば、この機会で全部の日本人に情報工学とハッカソンの力と可能性を気づかせます。

We are three friends, **Edoardo Odorico (edoardoo)**,  **Lorenzo Farnararo (baldarn)**  and **Sanjeya Cooray (Sanje)** from Florence, Italy. We all studied engineer. While we were studying Edo and Lorenzo joined our University Open Source Software Lab, LILiK, where they developed their coding and unix skills, and some free software philosophy. 
Together with other **LILiK** members they began to meet together at Edoardoo's house, in hacking sessions during the weekends. This is where they thought at first one of their success projects: turning lights on and off with an arduino, a raspberry, a pinch of javascript and a lot of hacking nights (usually with some wine, don't forget we're italian). Since we wanted to share our hard and funny work with the rest of the world, we've built a blog/tutorial about our hacking projects, hack.lenotta.com. We mainly hack on arduino, raspberry, antennas, HTML5, Javascript and CSS3. 
Lorenzo met Sanje while working together in a software house and we all knew from the very beginning he was the right full stack developer we were missing.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
We're skilled on both frontend and backend development. We'll probably use baaskets of javacript (perhaps for the server side too, why not?) and we would like to bleach the mess of EULA and TOS around, compress it, colour it and... you'll see (me heheheh)...
Update (1/12/2014): maybe some changes in plans? maybe some multimedia stuff? Something is boiling under the plate...



---------------------------------------

HackOwls
========
__Why do we want to join the competition?__

- To have fun, gain experience, meet new people and form a great team.

We are a group of three hackers hailing from [Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar](http://qatar.cmu.edu).
Two of us are graduates and one is currently a student.
Our members have previously participated in hackathons and even helped organize, mentor, or judge a hackathon or two.
We decided to join this hackathon to combine the different skills and experiences we gathered throughout the different paths we have embarked on to hack on something of great.


## About the team

  - **Ossama Obeid:** I am a research associate working in the field of Natural Language Processing. I have previously co-founded a company working on iOS apps for local clients. My interests include hacking software and hardware, painting, and reading up on Physics, Psychology, and History. Aiming to be a Renaissance man :)

  - **Afnan Fahim:** Hacker for all things front-end and aspiring new media artist. Side hobbies include learning languages. I envision a day when I will be able to travel to any country and communicate kinda sorta effectively.

  - **Mahmoud Alismail:** I am a CS junior at CMU. I enjoy working on computer vision applications and backend development. I like to use Django, Node, and OpenCV on my backends. In my free time, I tend to hack RGB+D cameras as well as highly scalable web applications.


## What are we doing?
Our idea is not solid yet but we will be writing a web app using Python for our back-end and HTML, JS, and CSS for our front-end.
We will be possibly utilizing NLP technologies and APIs such as NLTK, wit.ai, or IBM Watson.

This application will contain a reach front-end and some WebSocket features.
Other details are classified now :)

---------------------------------------

Team Hatzors!
=============

We are three grade 10 students in Canada, looking to see what we can do here. Together we are quite fluent in `HTML`/`CSS`/`JS`, `Python`, and are learning `Swift` and dabbling in lots of other languages. We've got about 15 years of code experience between the three of us.

We are:
-------
### Eden S.-G.

<div style="float:right"><img src="http://edensg.me/files/images/blueglitch.gif" style="width:300px" /></div>
I mainly work on front-ends, usually in `HTML`/`CSS`/`JS`. I also dabble in Blender, Inkscape and GIMP for design work. I put some of my web work [here](http://edensg.me/), and I have a bunch of design/visuals [here](http://edensg.me/files.html#files%2Fimagesl) and [here](https://edensg.github.io/#page-nav-CGI) (haven’t updated this last page in a while). I’ve been exploring Jekyll and `SASS`, and have been using tools like Node.JS and `Ruby` for a while now.

I was introduced to coding in grade four by an awesome teacher I had — he had a bunch of Commodore 64s in the classroom and taught the entire class the basics of `BASIC`. I ended up making text-based adventures, lottery/probability games, and even a conversation engine (it didn’t say much, but it did work). The next year I made a full game of Asteroids in Scratch, complete with X, Y and rotational momentum and acceleration, and asteroid splitting. I since have taught myself `HTML`/`CSS`/`JS` through Codecademy, and have started making an online version of [Vector 3](https://web.archive.org/web/20131115042508/http://playthisthing.com/vector-3) with Three.JS. I have contributed code for Fight For the Future, have made interactive online infographics for school projects, and have attended a local hackathon for Global Hack Day where I set up a Pi to run as a transparent Tor proxy.

### Michael Barker

<div style="float:right"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Meloun.jpg/640px-Meloun.jpg" style="width:300px" /></div>

I am 15 years old, and have been programming since I was 11. I have been taught Java 8 and Python 3 at school, but have pursued many other languages on my own time, including `C`, `C++`, `Objective-C`, and `Swift`, plus a few scripting languages, such as `Bash`, `Perl`, and `Ruby`. I got into scripting because I wanted to automate things that I did repeatedly, and that opened up doors to learning higher-level languages, rather than just scripting.

I am also very interested in Bitcoin. I have been mining Bitcoin since May of this year, and I’ve made about 0.4 BTC (about 168 CAD as of the time of writing). I think that cryptocurrencies will be used a lot in the future — Cryptocurrencies cannot be controlled by any central agency, so the value of the currency cannot be manipulated by the government to fit their own needs. Also, since they can easily be sent to anyone in the world no matter where they are, there would no longer be a need for currency exchange fees/inconvenience of exchanging currencies.

I have also been running a Tor relay, an I2P node, and a Freenet node (with 50GB of cache), contributing to three of the leading networks that protect privacy and anonymity online.

### Taj Dyson

<div style="float:right"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Tuxedo_%26_bowler_hat_1896.jpg" style="height:300px" /></div>

Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. 

I'm Taj, and I have had the illusion of consciousness for 15 years.

I code regularly, mostly in `Python`. I like object-based stuff.
Right now I am working on the soft/firmware of a wrist thingy/smartwatch with a Raspberry Pi. Some recent projects include an Arduino-controlled laser-prompted light switch, programmed, of course, with the Arduino IDE, and a food distribution simulator written in `Python` that has an AI that decides what to spend resources on.
Some dabbling has also been done into `HTML`, `Javascript`, and `BASIC` (where I started, in grade 5, with Eden).
Most of this has been self taught through the powers of the internet, with no school input.
I like to do things as simply and as straightforward as possible, favoring understandability over fanciness, and if anything gets too complex or nested, I tend to start over from a previous patch.
I also really like my hat.

<div style="clear:both">

## The plan...
*{insert maniacal evil laughter}*

We plan on recreating a three-dimensional space board game with ThreeJS and HTML5 Canvas for the browser. The game is based on strategy — there are many things to keep track of — and there are spaceships. Come on, who doesn't like spaceships? *Pew! Pew!* ***Kablooie!***

The game is turn-based, and involves acceleration, momentum and maybe even orientation in 3D space (or even 4D, if we get around to it). As you play the game, you will learn about calculating distances in multi-dimensional space, probability, falloff, and preemptive action.

### What we've got so far:

# Team Hekkie
We are Business & IT students at the University of Twente (NL) and colleages at Cofano Software Solutions with a passion for awesome stuff creation.

Our team name is inspired by a (Dutch) video-fragment ([view on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU83bmwMiYU)). It's about an employee of a company calling the the pound-sign on your phone "Hekkie" (which sound the same as the English term "Hacky"). This caused some confusion with the interviewed man, since "Hekkie" also means fence which he doesn't have, because he lives in a tower block.

I've only been a part of one 3-hour hackathon in the past, and I'd like to start
participating in more.  I have a long history of work, but I'd like to have a
personal portfolio of work outside of the jobs I've held.  I also enjoy coding
in my spare time, so participating in hackathons just makes sense! :)


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

I grew up coding games in my spare time and went to college for the same.
However, I switched gears in college after taking a web development course, and
that's what I've been doing ever since (with some mobile projects in the mix
too).

For this project, I'll probably try to mix the two, creating a web-based game.
I'm not 100% sure if this is what I'm going to actually do, but it's a pretty
good bet!

# Team In-Toke-A-Bola

Though I'm a team of one, I'm passionate about software development, engineering and just building fun and interesting tools and products.

# About the team
| Eric |

| <img width="100" height="100" src='eric.jpg' alt='Photo of Eric'/> |

# Motivation
I've joined this hackathon because I'm trying to bootstrap 2 companies in my time outside of my normal (full-time) day to day job.  Winning this competition could help me fund operational costs of these companies and build my own software company.  I'm passionate about my projects and I'd like to retire at 40.  Then I can enjoy the outdoors more often here in Colorado and focus on supporting various public-serving organizations by building tools and software for them.  Some of those organizations are: [CAIC](http://avalanche.state.co.us/about-us/),   [The Access Fund](http://www.accessfund.org/), [Friends of Berthoud Pass](http://berthoudpass.org/#sthash.FK69QPZG.dpbs), [Friends of Indian Creek](https://friendsofindiancreek.wordpress.com/mission/), ...

# Skills / Concept
I'm skilled in development using a number of different technologies: Java, Ruby on Rails, Angular JS, etc.,  to name a few.

I've seen a number of different HTML5 / Angular Games out there, and that might be what I go for.  I do live in Colorado, so building an app for the Medical Marijuana Industry is not off the table.

<img width="100" height="100" src='http://i.imgur.com/KbwBKnH.png' alt='Incorgito'/>

Incorgito is composed of Mark Steve Samson and Beato Bongco from the Philippines. We took one look at the hackthon themes and decided to join. You had us at educational HTML5 games.

We work at [Insync](https://insynchq.com) doing web development, but the only reason we really even dipped our toes into the world of programming was to try and make games. As with many things in life, you often end up doing something else entirely than what you set out to do. As time passed, the world of application and web development consumed us. But the urge to develop a game has always burned at the back of our minds and will probably never leave us. When we read the topic list on koding.com, we immediately saw the opportunity to combine two things we love: making games and teaching others how to program.

We want to win this hackathon because it will validate our that voice at the back of our heads. We want to win because we believe programming is an essential skill in the world today, and we want to be the ones that help spread the fire.

We are Incorgito. Expect us.

Jason Hughes (VonMises) is a father of three.  He and his wife homeschool their children.  He worked his way through college working in technical support for a software company that services the hotel industry.  After graduation he transitioned into development, bringing his coworkers (autt and jbeard88) with him.  VonMises is interested in working collaboratively on a project inside a defined window of time.  Even though they work together, they rarely get to be involved with the entire design and devlopment process in a collaborative way.

Our second team mate is Brandon McCartney (autt).  More info to come.

Rounding out the trio is Jeffery Beard (jbeard88).  More info to come.

J-Unit
================

We are Ali and Bobby, a strong developer / designer team. Ali is located in Lahore,
Pakistan, while Bobby is in Boston, U.S.

We met during work a few months ago. Due to our complimentary skills and good work chemistry,
we decided we'd be the dream team for going into this hackathon together.

About us
===========================
Our team has a yin/yang philosophy. Bobby, the yin, does all the design, CSS,
and UX work. Ali, the yang, does the backend programming to bring everything together.
This works great, as we have skills that compliment each others' weaknesses.

Our name, 'J-Unit', comes from our mutual love of hip hop and unit testing,
mixed with the fact that we use Java as our main programming language, for both client and server side.

Our biggest motivation for participating in this hackathon, is so we can have a shot at an interview
with some of the awesome VCs who are on the judges' panel. Our dream is to do a startup,
and we have an awesome idea that we'd love to pitch.

About Team Bad Aces
===========================

Being blind my whole life, technology has been my window into a world I couldn't see, I got started in te world of software development by writing [JAWS](http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS) scripts to make programs work properly. I heard about the hackathon through [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8517846), it sounded like a lot of fun, and I have a few ideas I'd like to work on.

How we are getting to the moon...

### Hi, I'm Alex.

I'm a developer, currently staying in Oxford.
I usually write [code](https://github.com/noraesae) in JavaScript and
Scala, sometimes in Python and Go as well. I'm also keen to learn many
other new things. I love to read and [write](https://medium.com/@noraesae)
something. In my spare time, I like to sleep, [diarize](http://yuiazu.net),
cycle, listen to [music](http://noraesae.net/music), travel and take a
photo.

### Hi, I'm Yong-uk.

I'm a developer who barely write code these days cause I have no
interest in anything but [*LOVELIVE*](http://www.lovelive-anime.jp)
recently.
I have experience in C++(especially in WebKit), Obj-C, JavaScript,
Python, etc... Nothing's been left in my brain, though. But it's
okay. Google is always with me.

My Story
==============
My name is Loqman Hakimi. I'm software and web developer from Iran.

The reason I want to participate in this competetion is like any other person that wants
to be a part of this hackaton "To Compete" and also the money :) .

My Skills
=====
I love coding in Ruby and using Rails to develop web applications.
and also like coding in javascript and using Node.js and Socket.io for realtime web
applications.

For front-end development Bootstrap and Font-Awesome are my choices.

As the theme of this hacketon is problems faceing the earth, and as I recently watched on the "Last Week Tonighy with John Oliver"'s episode about global warming and some people still don't believe in it, I would like to create an app to visualize this fact.

I am just a developer trying to make a difference. I quit college in the last year to study what I want to study.
The picture you see is me when I was 19 after serving the army here in Brazil. Why did I serve? Just for the sake of it.
I wanted to loose some weight and get paid to do so, at least, that was how I was looking at it. 
Turned out to be one of the greatest experiences of my life and I am fucking proud of it.

I was born in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, my parents managed to move out from Rio to Curitiba, where I currently live in.
Here I managed to get a great education, entered one of the best public schools and got a 100% schollarship from the government and started studying Computer Science at the Catholic University.

I am proud of my achievements but, as I you can see, I am facing this single handed. Why? Because I can't find people that are commited as I am.

I have great friends, don't get me wrong, but none of them is into programming. So, it's just me again facing challenges. 
Hahaha


My Stack
=======
- PHP using Laravel
- Javascript (jQuery, AngularJS)
- PostgresSQL
- Phonegap (maybe)

We are part of a young start-up, and we joined this hackathon to challenge ourselves and try to get new ideas and renew our determination to keep going forward.

About skills and project
========================
The goal of our project is to show the correlation between good analogies and the mastering of programming skills via simple games. This corresponds to the second theme.
To be fair, we can work with many languages and frameworks. But, for this particular project, we may use only these:
	- C
	- VB.NET
	- HTML and JS

Jordyn and Mark have been coding together both on and off the job for over 6 years now. We initially joined the hackathon because of the opportunity to do something based on climate change.

However, when the topics were announced, we both felt drawn towards the privacy policy / terms of service topic. That is the topic we ended up choosing.

We plan to make a web application to this effect. We have a good idea of what we're building. API choices are pending

Our team is completely virtual and remote. I met Rodion on Twitter few days ago and have never seen him before. He is great and I love to read his code, that's why we hack together at *OrangeVerse*.

'OrangeVerse' is the random name created using [Koding Global Hackathon Team Name Generator](https://vast-cove-6783.herokuapp.com/), which I created a few days before to give the name for our team. :-)

The team's **goal** for this competition is to *build great thing* during the hackathon and *show what the random can do*. Taleb's Black Swan. In Random We Trust.

Sincerely yours,
Vladimir and Rodion. :p

# About Me
<img width="100" height="100" src='http://i.imgur.com/niC2HLh.png' alt='Hubert'/>

Hi, my name is Hubert Chen. I am a student studying Software Engineering at Monmouth University, which is located in New Jersey, 
USA.

I would like to join this hackathon because it will be a great opportunity to challenge myself to build something that can
create a positive impact. After 4 years of school, I believe I have accumulated enough knowledge to build a full stack system.

As your typical broke college student, winning any sort of prize money would be a extremely helpful. However, given the sheer 
amount of teams (2,000 maximum) and probably being on the low end of experience in the Top Hacker category, the odds of myself
winning are unlikely. This does not deter me. Instead, I hope to try the best that I can and when the competition has subsided, 
analyze other people's work in the hopes that I may find new ways of approaching problems and designing solutions. 

Regardless of whether I get accepted, I would like to applaud the Koding team for hosting this event.

Thank you.

# About the Project
As it isn't the time to learn new technologies, I will be sticking with easy to use and familar technologies. My stack will include: 
Koding for hosting, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Bootstrap, CSS, JQuery, JS, and HTML.

Theme: Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization.

*APIs: Data.gov, Census.gov, WorldBank.org, Ip2Country through MashApe.

*This is bound to change as I am still playing around with a few ideas.

PumpedDevs
================
Hey! You've actually visited our page(?). We are pumpedDevs! We're thrilled to be part of the first Global Hackathon, well actually, this is the first hackathon for some of us. :)


About the team
===========================
Hi, we are **pumpedDevs**(pumped developers)! We're composed of 4 developers who love to develop apps for mobile and for web.

The team was created months ago (*May 2014*) before **Koding's Global Hackathon**. The original members were me(Ron), Bryan, and a friend of mine(*Not in the competition*). We established this team because of some reasons and our main goal is to start our own. We wanted to build our own **start up company**. Our problem is, **we don't have any idea how**; also our **time** and **budget** won't allow us. (*We have full-time and part time jobs. Long story on why we can't quit in any.*)

The time when we discovered the **hackathon**, we were so *excited*. But when we saw that there were only 1000(*2000 now*) slots for the hackathon, the excitement went down since we thought that it was somehow *"impossible"* for us(me) to be chosen. But I still tried! I told them, *"If we will be chosen, I will treat you guys!"*. So eventually, I treated them at a coffee shop(Starbucks)!

After a while, I asked the other two members to join us in this hackathon, **Kenneth**, my classmate when I was in college, and **Joell** who used to be our professor. They both develop for the **web** and they're **really great** at it so I thought they'd be perfect for the team and so I invited them. I also had an experience developing with them so I think it's an edge for us.

The team's **goal** for this competition is to *have fun* in the hackathon, *show what we can do* and *what we can contribute*. We think that this event is a **big help** for us to reach our goal which is to create our own **start up company** which can be beneficial for a lot of people. *Winning* in this competition might be **hard** and **intimidating**, but what isn't? We'll give it a shot and do our **best**!

About our skills and plans?
=======
All of us use the following technologies:

1. PHP
2. Javascript
3. HTML5

All of the themes given are really interesting. We're still thinking which will fit our skills.

I know this page is a bit long so here's a sweet potato. :sweet_potato: Sorry for the long post

I like the idea of the challenge of a  hackothon as a psychological space well suited to motivating creativity and productivity.  I'm hoping that helps me come up with something interesting and worthwhile outside the scope of my normal work.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I'm interested in both the theme of realtime communication and translation and the theme of problems facing our planet and data visualization.

I'm not entirely sure what I'd like to tackle specifically.  Perhaps I'll gather some other devs/designers and come up with a more concrete idea soon.

We are a group of technology enthusiasts from Sri Lanka currently based in different parts of the world ;) 

We are motivated to solve real world problems. We have identified that there is a huge gap between legal documents
such as TOS, EULA.. and the end user as they are reluctant to read them. We are on track to a novel and an efficient 
solution to address this issue with the use of latest realtime technologies with usability in mind.

I am a recent graduate of [Middle East Technical University](http://www.metu.edu.tr/), working at a independent game development company called [Taleworlds Entertainment]. (https://www.taleworlds.com/) Even though I am really interested in the idea, I was not able to participate in more than a couple of hackathons, usually due to the location of most of them being too remote to participate. This one being online is yet another reason that got me excited.

Assignments at school or work may be exciting or educational, but the spontaneity of creativity encouraged in hackathons help get the experience of developing to a whole new level.

I don't think my goal is to win. Rather, it is to produce something that I, and hopefully others as well, would like to make use of.


About our skills and what we are going to do?
=======

The TOS and EULA are one tough nut to crack, but it sure would be fun to tackle it as a weekend project. Any attempt to simplify understanding their coverage would surely require working on the front-end, which would make the implementation part an experimental endeavor to me, as I am more used to working in the back-end. I am still going through the wondrous APIs encouraged, though, and I may end up implementing something based on one (or a few) or them.

I am software developer and want to realize my idea in koding hackaton


About me
===========================


I am 26 and software developer and some monthes ago I found are there any online hackatons. And it was very surprisingly when I didn't find any. 
But now  I have got a mail from elance with explanation of koding.com hackaton and was very happy to know about it.
When I registered and was approved for participating I found that first theme (about global problems of the Earth) is very interesting for me.
I want to make something interesting, beatiful and of course  useful . And I want to win not for the money but for the communication with interesting people.


About my skills
=======
I think that programming is general skill. But of course there must be the platform where a programmer realizes his ideas.And 
nowadays I am focusing on web projects. I program on C# for ASP.NET /MVC/WebApi platforms, Javascript (jQuery and Angular.js mainly) for frontend. And I love alghoritms and especially I  like machine learning and big data, and using for it Python (May be I will move to that language in future :) )

We are a team of developers from Russia. We are working on their own start-ups, and some of the projects planned as opensource. We have a lot of interesting ideas, but the need to earn money does not allow us to devote much time to their start-ups. On the competition we have learned from the site habrahabr.ru and very interested as an opportunity to talk with other teams, as well as the chance to get funds for the development of our projects. If we win, the prize money will be spent on the development of useful new services and applications.

About our project.
===========================

We not a choose now which of our ideas to put into Hackathon, but as far as technology, the project will be based on Javascript. On the server we use Node.js, client-server communication via web sockets. Other details we will post before Hackaton.

The reason we joined this hackathon was to have a fun way to put our programming/problem solving skills to the test.

Josh and I both have a way of thinking about everything we encounter anything that causes problems or isn't efficient, how
can we fix this? It's this motivation that drives the majority of our projects, the rest of them fall along the lines of, 
"How can we turn this microwave into something useful other than cooking hot pockets?" Either way, it's our passion to make
things that can benefit people in whatever they are doing, making technology work for us, not the other way around.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
We tend to work better with html 5 and jQuery, our project will probably 
revolve around web technologies including PHP for our server side code. So
the educational multiplayer game sounds like a likely option for our theme choice.

# What we are going to do

All the given themes are really interesting and it is rather hard to pick one. As we like games and web development very much,
we want to stay within this direction. We would like to use Nginx, Nodejs, Javascript, HTML5 and some awesome API to realize our project.
Our goal is to create something creative and helpful.

---------------------------------------

Hi everyone.My name is Hristo and I'm a 19 years old software engineering student. I'm going to be building a WebGL game using
Three.js & Javascript(of course). I have an idea about the game and I won't be revealing it just yet so stay in touch.

I'm also looking for people to join my team that's why I will give you a brief introduction about what I can do and what my skills are.
For the past 6 months I have been working in a company in the area of computational chemistry. I'm involved in projects which
for the most part solve problems with the help of graph theory. This is where my strength lies. I"m also a C# certified specialist
and I have some good amount of experience developing applications & also a good amount of presentation skills. I'm also lucky enough
to be a MSP and MCP. If you are passionate about games and like to create stuff that move please don't hesitate to contact me.
I'm looking for technically skilled persons and design and user interface is going to be the second most important thing.

Thanks !

We are two interaction design/computer science students from Oslo, Hans and Nicolai.

---


**Hans** is currently studying Interaction Design at the University of Oslo. He is originally from Iceland but moved to Norway at a young age where he has lived since. He is an active photographer when not busy with school.
He also enjoys long walks on the beach, candelit dinners and knitting, and practicing pastafarianism.

He coded from a young age with copy-pasting and mixing Javascript snippets on his website made in Frontpage 2000, then did some Visual Basic 6, GameMaker 6 and PHP. He tried to forget that time of his life by drinking copious amounts of Aquavit. He has since then gotten his life together and now develops in a multitude of technologies, for the moment he has a soft spot for Go.


---

Nicolai is at the time being studied at the University of Oslo. ..or was it the other way around?
He is a guitarist in a [big band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_band) called Big Boss Band.
He lives in a party mansion, also commonly known as "Mom and Dad's Basement".
He is afraid of the dark, and exceptions in PHP.

**Nicolai** got a flying start with tutorials from W3Schools (A Norwegian site, actually  :no_mouth: , for which we sincerely apologize on behalf of the Kingdom of Norway™ for letting in to this world).

He once developed a CMS targeted towards the elderly to help them manage an event planning site on their own. He is passionate about interaction and user experience and thinks the most important facet of any application is an intuitive interface.  
His graphic design skills can be considered lacklustre, but he compensates with his capabilities as a programmer and makes designs come to life with great care. 
 
---

We love hackathons. Being given the option to creatively and emotionally unfold and unleash the Codebro within, is the best thing in the world (except pure norwegian kebabs). 

Skills and Plans
================
Hans has experience in Go, Python, C, Javascript and loads of tools and libraries for them. He is also capable of designing and creating great and simple user interfaces and interactions for web, desktop and mobile applications.

Nicolai has for the most part worked with web development and the languages and technologies that accompany that field.
That means Javascript for the most part, but also Go and Python. On his spare time he enjoys exercising his brain with languages like Scheme, Standard ML, Scala and Prolog.

Fun fact: The blue cap on Nicolai's image is actually red (read: Mario color) but was Photoshop™-ed by his horrible, horrible ex.

---

We plan to try our hand at an multiplayer educational game using React for interface and Canvas/WebGL. Backend will be written in Go, and we want to try out WebRTC for P2P communication if we get the time.

## About Me

Greetings Koding Hackathon Judges,

I can not express in words how grateful I would be for the opportunity to compete in the first global hackathon. Several years ago I participated as an individual in NASA's ISS challenge (to develop an algorithm to improve solar panel efficiency during low-light orbits). Although my results ranked in the top 1% of entries, I lost my internet connection at the deadline and was not able submit my solution. I have since been waiting for a competition to redeem myself, and this seems like the perfect fit.

I have been fascinated with computers since I was four years old, and have been coding in various languages for over 20 years with an emphasis in web development. While I have a vast general knowledge of modern technology in general, my areas of expertise are primarily related to LAMP, HTML5/CSS3, Javascript/jQuery, and ImageMagick, but I also have extensive experience in many other areas.

Since 2008 I have worked as a self-employed developer and information systems consultant. I've developed for a number of companies and individuals, including CCPensieve, The Daily Cafe and 360start.com. For the past two years I have contracted primarily for Idexx Laboratories, Inc. as the lead developer on several internal-use applications. My long-term goal in life is to develop free-use solutions using technology (in the same sense as Wikipedia).

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to see you again on the 6th and 7th!

Sincerely,
M. Murphy

I'm a freelance developer, interested in Web development
Hackathon – a good incentive to apply my knowledge of different areas in a single project

My goal is not to win, it's a challenge for me – in a short period of time to create a project that will be useful for many people

the most interesting theme for me is "HTML5 educational multiplayer game"

I will use PHP + node.js + iron.io and WebGL + Canvas... may also WebSpeechAPI

TNTeam
========

## Who we Are

Our team consists of a mix of experienced hacker veterans, promising
programming rising stars, and artists, all from Tunisia.  Some of us
know each other since quite a while now (Rafik and Mohamed were
classmates since high school), met during work (Rafik , Elyes and
Ibtissem are coworkers) or while attending Kendo training (Rafik and
Chakib are Kenshis). But all in all, TNTeam is made of only friends,
that share a deep love for hacking and love arts.

* `Rafik` and `Mohamed` are Back-End Developers and
architects. They'll probably will write Clojure and Java. `Mohamed` is
an egg on twitter because he chose to.
* `Ibtissem` is an experienced Front-End infrastructure engineer,
though also having her word to say on back-end side of things. She
knows a couple of things about Clojure, Java, HTML5 and JS.
* `Elyes` is a promising Web Developer, experienced in designing and
integrating cool web apps.
* `Chakib` is the artist of the team. He will create unique AND
  amazing artwork for our work.

And here's what we all look like:

Rafik | Mohamed | Ibtissem | Elyes | Chakib

On the very first sight we are ordinary team with team lead and coders. On the other hand each of us is "The One". 
We are personalities with high ambitions, self-motivation and professional background.

We are participating in Hackathon to prove ourselves, get great non-stop-Koding experience and to get fun (Koding is funny, isn't it?).


"Wazzap"
=======
Like most of checked-in teams we are "still brainstormin". We are going to use up-to-date technologies. 
At this moment, seems that we will use PHP/node.js + MySQL/Mongo (maybe hybrid), Angular.js, DataDog API, nginx for server and some of provided APIs (we are not sure yet).


Best wishes
===========
We are wishing all the luck to all participients (ofcourse we have it already taken). Let the Koding begin! :)

Hey! I'm a high school student who loves to learn Computer Scince. I've been learning about computers and the web ever since elementary school. Starting from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to programming languages in middle school such as PHP, and Visual Basic. Now in high school, I have mastered PHP and Java. I have visited Googleplex after becoming the Grand Prize Winner in Google Code-In 2013, the first ever programming contest I participated in. 

This will be my first Hackathon, and I am excited to be taking part in the first global hackathon!


Skills / Plans
==============
I am interested in theme 5, challenges associated with real time communication and translation. Although PHP is my best language, I will try to use Node.js to solve this problem as you can have real-time direct connections with the server and the client using socket.io.

We decided to join the Hackathon for the opportunity to learn and be a part of a large community. This Hackathon will prove individual skills and ways for us to improve certain areas that we lack. Collaborating with various individuals on similar tasks is a fun and educational way to learn coding as well as building something innovative. 


About our skills
=======
Each one of our team members has strengths and weaknesses in certain areas. Combined we are truly a force to be reckoned with. One opportunity, One Project, and our determination to give it our all! 

Thank you for learning a bit about team Iron Squad and CODE ON!

About the Team
===========================

We are Team Banana Stand. We're from Toronto, Canada.

| Peony | Manu | Jason | Travis
|--- |--- |--- |---
| <img width="100" height="100" src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/498100595962937344/iFcCo2ci_400x400.jpeg' alt='Peony'/> | <img width="100" height="100" src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/378800000041376391/36373bdf958000782d38565d415c9b43_400x400.jpeg' alt='Manu'/> | <img width="100" height="100" src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2246824386/badASS_400x400.jpg' alt='Jason'/> | <img width="100" height="100" src='https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2218626636/image_400x400.jpg' alt='Travis'/> |

TL;DR: Travis, Peony and Jason are partial-full stack developers and Manu is a janitor. They all share a common love for science.

1. Peony is a web designer and front-end developer. She prefers to work at the bleeding edge of front-end spec, and her workflow would probably make Paul Irish jealous.
2. Manu is not a janitor IRL, he's more like a services savant. If you need service development, or simply some sweet Python magic, he's your man.
3. When he's not busy saving the world from best practice failures or thinking of what to tweet next, Jason is busy building stuff while using a mindblowing variety of resources. Apps, web-apps, APIs, you name it. If Macgyver needed the equivalent of a developer swiss-army knife, Jason would make the role.
4. Travis is a front-end developer who has a lot of experience with devops because it "comes with the territory". In a previous life, he was a backend dev. On that note, he's currently doing his best to hate PHP and love NodeJS.

Joining was Peony's idea, and needless to say, we all jumped at the chance to be a part of global hackathon. Win or lose, we're looking to challenge ourselves by implementing as much as possible into our final idea. 

Skills and Plans
=======
As a combined team, we use these languages on the daily:
- Javascript
- Python
- Scala
- Objective C
- Java
- PHP

APIs that we are like include but are not limited to:
- DATADOG
- Twitter
- Google Predictions
- Google Geocoding
- Google Freebase

We're trying to come up with an impressive idea that has a tight-enough scope to complete in time. Ideally this is going to be a web-app that's out-of-the-box in nature, is built on services leveraging a plethora of APIs, and has a gorgeous front end. After throwing ideas around for the past few evenings, the team is mostly talking about going with either themes #1 or #5.

The Imperial Guard
==================

Based on the name of the fans of [Racing Club de Avellaneda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_Club_de_Avellaneda), this team is here to teach why we're called **"The Academy"**.


About the team
==============

The objective is to hone my skills by doing service to the community by doing the only thing I can do: ___code___.


Skills
======

I'm a Python lover, specially for the making of web applications. I love Flask, and will use it whenever I can over anything else. I'm also a Desktop developer fanboy and use PySide for anything that's not web. Good at JavaScript, if that's something.

# The Washington Redskins

We are five high-school students from Los Angeles, only one of whom actually plays football.
Our name was inspired by South Park episode ["Go Fund Yourself" (Season 18, Episode 1)](http://southpark.cc.com/full-episodes/s18e01-go-fund-yourself) and we in no other way affiliated with the National Football League team of the same name.

Please support us and share your experiences/money with us on our [team page](https://www.facebook.com/thewashingtonredskinshack)!

## About our team

[James]: http://i.imgur.com/6WhfoIZm.png?2 "A day in the life"
[Jake]: http://i.imgur.com/IFEuZNEm.png?2 "Khakis"

`Ethan`'s experience lies primarily with Java, although he has dabbled in and is learning other languages. He has published two applications: [En Garde'/>, an Android fencing score-keeping app, and [HyperTyper](http://ethanmad.com/HyperTyper), a Chrome extension that helps (cheats) in online typing competitions. He has little experience with the Web outside of static websites, so he is looking to learn a lot with The Washington Redskins.

`David` is passionate about teaching others how to 'Kode', as demonstrated by his project, [Koding 4 Kids](http://koding4kids.com). Right now, however, his teaching is on hold until we teach y'all a lesson.

`Christian`, also known as 'quantum' or '[paralin](http://parl.in)' is known primarily for [D2Moddin](http://paral.in/the-d2moddin-project/), which brought custom game modes to over 174,000 DOTA 2 players. Christian's in-progress projects include two other DOTA projects, WebLeague and DotaReplay, in addition to his VTOL PixHawk autonomous UAV project. Previous projects are listed on [his website](http://paral.in/projects/) with links to GitHub repositories.

`James` is an algorithms expert and is top 50 on the USACO rankings in 2014. James actually [invented the subordinate-sequential search algorithm](https://koding.com/jlennon1) with the help of fellow Koders. James has also created several published games, including [Nebulus](https://itunes.apple.com/app/nebulous-multiplayer-space/id874328065?mt=8) and [Driftlight](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/driftlight/id908131148?mt=8).

`Jake` is an esteemed hacker who often goes by the name of '4chan'. He's apparently very infamous. You better not go and tell CNN his real name!

## What we're making

It's quite possible that we are inventing the most revolutionary product ever made! [As part of our review of playing field, we have decided to move forward with cloud-based early adopter. Skate to where the puck is going to be.](http://projects.wsj.com/buzzwords2014/#p=13%7C35,13%7C%7C6%7C%7C2%7C2) Steve Jobs may [1] have decreed "the iRedskins (formerly The Washington Redksins) is the most revolutionary and magical product Apple has made yet" while tripping on an LCD in India.

Expect us on Kickstarter [2] soon [3]!

[4]: Literally and totally impossible


---------------------------------------

About the Team:
---------------

Our three member team consists of game development champion Dipen, web and backend guru Parth and jack of all trades Anuj.

What's unique about this team is that each member prefers a different language than the rest of the team members. Dipen prefers C#, Parth prefers JS and Anuj prefers Python. While we'll probably end up spending countless hours arguing the benefits of different languages and frameworks, we do have one saving grace. All three of us speak three of same spoken languages- English, Gujarati and Hindi. At least we'll be able to carry out the argument without having to resort to non-verbal tactics :P.


What we're going to build:
--------------------------

Of the themes mentioned in the contest rules, one theme that resonated between all three of us is the idea of introducing software development to beginners through games. We all feel like software development would have been much more exciting if our first few tutorials had been related to game development. We believe that this would have fueled our curiosity and given us enough intrinsic motivation to go ahead and experiment with the language, the product and the environment. We hope that we can create such a product during this hackathon, and possibly even continue building it past the prototype stage and into production.

About the team and team members?

I am Parth Pankaj Tiwary and I am from India, I am currently in the 3rd year of my 4 year bachelors degree in 
computer science and engineering. Data fascinates me and the way we structure our data in order to make some sense
out of it, I have a thing for typography and I am a strong believer of minimalist approach, I do try and keep things
simple.


About the skills that I have or I might use in this hackathon?

I have co-founded one startup that is frameinn.com, I do know Django, python and its recently that I have ventured
for MEAN stack and what can be made using MEAN stack.  I have a thing for data visualization, as it precisely explains
what minimalistic approach is. I guess that is most of it, I will be taking up a project related to the data and the
way we have structured our data so far and how should we go about changing it, in order to put it to its actual use.

The HD One
================
Hello world! My name is Pavel, and I'm the only member of the team. It's my first hackathon and I hope it will be fun.

A little bit about me
===========================
I'm software engineer from Kharkiv, Ukraine. Decision to participate in Koding Hackathon was a spontaneous, but I think it's a very good chance for me to verify my experience in out of the ordinary situation.

<img width="100" height="100" src='https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/333910?v=3&s=256' alt='bashmach | The HD One'/>


About your skills and what you are going to do?
===========================

At the moment I'm not totally sure about theme of my project, but most likely it would be something that is related with realtime data streaming.

Planning to use Node.js as a main platform.

---------------------------------------

The Thought Engineer
================

This is Samer Bechara, The Thought Engineer. I'm participating in this koding hackathon for a change, for a challenge, and winning! (Doh!)


About me
===========================

I've been developing web applications since 2007, and by 2010 I became pretty good - or that's what I like to think.

I've been working online since 2007 , back when we had 128Kbps internet here in Lebanon. For the first few years, my parent and my friends thought I was crazy, but then I understood that I was making money online, not trying to run away from finding a real job.

I've decided to joing because I wanted to challenge myself, and solve some of the problems in your koding themes (No- I'm not telling which one now - we still haven't started!)

I don't care if I win or not, seriously! What I really care about is overcoming myself and pushing my boundaries. Winning is just a secondary result, not the main goal. (Judges - don't let that influence you. I still like to win)


What am I really good at, and what am I going to do?
=======

The more complex the problem is, the simpler the solution I come up with. I've programmed tens of APIs, done frontend and backend programming, managed servers, and market my own business. 

Programming isn't just about writing code, it's about solving problems the world is facing. If you want to kill my soul, ask me to reinvent the wheel. I focus as much as I can on creating innovative solutions for problems that my clients are facing. If a solution has been already created, no need to create it again. Programmers, you can change the world, so stop writing contact forms! :)

Most probably I'll be working on solving the TOS problem. As a website owner and website visitor, it's a problem I fairly undertand and now, and believe that I have some pretty cool ideas to solve this problem.

Tell us who you are, why you did you decide to join?
======
I love coding, and it is not just my job, it’s my hobby, business, love, my life. 
For the short while I have been on this earth. Developing has been a huge part of my life, so much that if I didn’t have development I would be lost.
I love to play with it, In my spare time I surf the web to keep in touch with new technologies. 
I am working with web applications from last 4+ year.
I am also a nature lover, and I love more than coding, I try to help to save the nature.
I am also master degree student & family responsibilities so I have no much time to physically help them (http://support.wwfindia.org/sos/index.php) but I had decided to donate some part of my salary to them before two months. I also would like to donate 10% of my prize.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I will go with Theme#1 to develop application.

UniLasers
=============

We're team UniLasers, a small team of two people based out of Toronto. We consider ourselves hobbyist programmers, we enjoy programming but don't have enough chances to do so at work or after work. Neither of us have ever participated in a Hackathon before, but this global Hackathon seems like a great place to begin! 

It's time to see how well we stack up against the other 1999 teams in this Hackathon! 

What we're going to do
=============

Honestly, we're not sure yet. One of us is stronger with backend technologies, one of us is better with frontend, so we'll see how that goes.

We're still deciding between the first and third theme as those two plays to our strengths, we'll commit a change to this file once we decide!

For sure we'll be making use of PHP, nginx, and a bunch of JavaScript libraries that can help us code fast in 48h. Any other APIs and technologies will be determined once we decide on a theme.

Yet Another Team
================
Hello hackers/koders!

As you might have noticed by now, this team is called "Yet Another Team" (yes, not the most creative name).

About the team
--------------
This is a "single-member" team.

Just like you probably are, I am just another enthusiast, who believes that he can contribute (even in a small way), to a better world.

The name is inspired by the Linux community, which widely uses the "YA" acronym.
I highly admire this community, that is well-known for providing clever ideas, often in an altruistic way.

Although winning one of the categories would be very nice, this is not what drives me to join this contest.
It is the idea that I can contribute to help people, in some way, what drives me.

About my skills and purpose
---------------------------
I currently work as a Technical Support agent for a partner of a well-known network corporation.

It is my hobby to program (in various languages, including PHP, JavaScript, Java and C++).
My dream is to become a good programmer, for this is what I enjoy the most.

I consider myself a hacker, since I like to customize things to work better for me.

I would like to address the need for a better way to deliver legal documents (EULA, TOS), although I cannot provide a lot of details, at the time.


---------------------------------------

## Hi, I'm Jeremy.
### I'm a recent college graduate of the University of California, San Diego. I'm taking some time off before I start working, and I'm using this time to do things that I didn't have too much time for in college. Some of these things include working on my own projects, playing more guitar, writing, and reading more books.

### I decided to join the Koding Global Hackathon because I love making things, and this is just another opportunity to do so.

## What am I doing?
### I'm not sure yet, but it's probably going to be something related to my passion of enabling others to pursue their passions. I've done a lot of STEM outreach back in college, so maybe I'll create a game. I'll update this later.

Koding's instructions for writing ABOUT.md tell you to make it emotional and impressive. I find it more important to make it honest. I'm Frederik Creemers, a Belgian web geek. I'm visually impaired. My optic nerves never fully developed, so glasses don't help.
Because of my impairment, I've always needed the help of technology. In high school, at a point where I was supposed to be doing homework, I started toying around in powerpoint. I found out a feature that allowed you to go to a different slide when the mouse hovered
over a certain element of the current slide. This gave me the great idea to create mouse mazes, where you had to get your cursor from start to finish without touchhing a wall. This got me more interested in how games were created, and so I  downloaded GameMaker, a tool by YoYoGames,
that allows you to create games without programming. It does include a language called GML (game maker language), which was my introduction to programming. At school, we learned how to make a website, which introdduced me to the wonders of the web as a platform, and that's what got me to where I currently am.

The reason I'm entering this hackathon, is because I sometimes need a little push to release something. I've got a lot of projects in my 'dev' directory that are hafway there to being something I could release to the world. I'm hoping that this hackathon will push me to create something that I can be proud of.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
I'm creating an app that allows people without any coding experience to create their own web application.
Some of the things I'll probably use:

 - blockly
 - github's api
 - Google App Engine
 - Any other APi I can build in in time that can enhance the applications that users build.
 
I might change my mind, and build applications using firebase instead of App Engine.

We are a team of developers and hackathon lovers.

We have been waiting for this competition for a long time and each of us have a specific reason to be here, but if there is one word that can describe what we are hoping to find here is: Opportunity.

Opportunity to work together in something new and exciting. Opportunity to have fun in this fast paced life. And opportunity to win something that can really make a difference in our future carriers!




Two of us are really good with front-end development, but node.js is here and we have been building awesome things with it. The other one is a rails ninja and have been asked to work in tons of nice companies (but he really likes his own company).

<h1><b>This is our page</b></h1>

<em>Well actually it's just me for now. I am from Bosnia and Herzegovina, currently living in Sarajevo.</em>

<h1><b>About your team</b></h1>

<em>My name is Emina Šahbegović, I am twenty-one years old and I am a second year student at International Burch Univercity in 
Sarajevo, Bosnia. I have decided to try and join the hackaton because I am a curious person and like to take as many 
opportunities as possible to gather more knowledge when it comes to programming. I have fallen in love with 
programming and would like to become one of the best programmers in this world, but since I started relatively late compared to 
my colleagues it will probably take some time till I get there. I would really like to become one of the best programmers for 
two reasons. First reason would have to be so I can pay my family everything back that they invested in me and finally be 
independent. The second reason is because I really respect smart people and would love to become a smart person who is needed 
in society.</em>

<h1><b>Abut your skills and what you are going to do?</b></h1>

<em>Since my skills in coding are still at a beginners level, it's possible that it won't kick people from their chairs but 
I will try to make the best project I've made yet. I do have some skills ehn it comes to design and art so hopefully it will 
make up a little for the lack of knowledge in coding. I will try to build a PC game and it will, hopefully, be interesting.</em>

#cool_kid_alert

##Alan

Just a high schooler on the east coast who wants to test his skills. 
I doubt I will win, but I just want to see what participating feels like. 
Never really knew what I wanted to do until my first day of Freshman year, when I walked into Computer Science class Period 1. Hello World in Java seemed magical to me, and I knew exactly what I wanted to do when I "grew up".
Since then, I've tried to learn as much as I can, as fast I can. I found myself overreaching at one point, trying to become a coding polyglot- I was trying to learn 3 or more languages at once, which did not work. So I focused on learning a few things, and learning them well.
  And I got an internship at an informatics lab! 

##Kevin
  Known as "Bear". Algorithm master and High School math wiz. Straight out of Longmont.
  I'm pretty sure I'm cooler than Alan. I think. 
  I like to work with C/C++, so if you need help, I'd be happy to give you some **pointers**.

#Skills/Experience
##Alan: 
Javascript, Java, HTML/CSS, a little Python and Ruby.
D3.js, Node, Sails.
##Kevin:
HTML/CSS, Javascript, Java, C++, C.


We want to make an interactive website to explain and visualize the severity of Global Warming with interactive charts of all shapes and sizes.
Obviously, we'd use d3.js for that.
Another cool idea would be a way for people to highlight the most important parts of a legal document for users to read and then some sort of game to make sure people read those sentences, at least.

###Welcome to darapti!


###About me
P. Coleman.
* College student
* Philosophy major
* Formal logic geek
* Solo novice developer


###What in the world's a darapti?
<p>Darapti is one of the valid categorical syllogisms in formal logic, as constructed by Aristotle.</p>
<p>A syllogism is an argument consisting of two or more premises and a conclusion. It uses deductive reasoning to arrive at the conclusion from the premises.</p>
<p>There are 256 possible syllogisms, but only ~20 valid forms.
However, Aristotle's system proved hard to memorize alone (too many darn vowels), so the medievals created mnemonics for the valid forms.
Darapti is one of them.</p>
(paraphrased from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism))


###Darapti as a syllogism: 
```
Premise: All hackathons are fun events.
Premise: All hackathons are strenuous events.
Conclusion: So, some strenuous events are fun events.
```

###Why darapti?
1. Darapti is a weakened form. For the conclusion to be true, it must assume that the terms in the premises are.</p>
2. It's a reminder for me to check all parts of my program and make sure they function. Otherwise, just like an argument, it'll fall apart.</p>
3. Logic is how I gained the confidence to code.
4. Darapti also rolls off the tongue well (dah-rahp-tee).</p>

###Why hackathon?
1. Why not?
2. I've been sitting on my butt with some ideas, but haven't been inspired to build them yet.
3. I like the opportunity to try to build something in a limited time frame.


###Skillset and Ambitions
* a cup of PHP/MySQL
* a pinch of JavaScript
* a dash of HTML/CSS
* I'll create either an educational game or something to help with the fine print.
* Not sure of specific APIs at the moment.

Welcome to Hawaii Hackers
================

I am a student studying computer science at the University of Hawaii at Hilo.


About your team
===========================
I'm a Senior in the Computer Science department at UH Hilo. I first came to Hawaii in search of a fresh start back in December of 2007. 
I didn't really know what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, but I did know I needed a way to make a living. I took a job with a
large ornamental plant farm. It was hard work, and the pay was just barely enough to get by. Yet, in spite of all of this, riding around
on a tractor all day gave me a great deal of time to think. And as I thought, I realized that I wanted to go back to school. 

I enrolled at Hawaii Community College in its Information Technology program back in the Spring of 2009. Going back to school breathed
new ambition and new life into my soul, and so I decided to leave the farm and eventually took a job with Upward Bound, a college prep for
low income and first generation high schoolers, as a tech instructor for their Summer Academy. They were pleased with the way I interacted
with the students, and with my knowledge of computers, and ultimately offered me a position as their IT Specialist.

I graduated from the IT Program in the Spring of 2011 at the top of my class. From there, I made the decision to transfer to UH Hilo's 
Computer Science Program. The CS Program has taught me a love for programming and problem solving that I never knew I had. I became extremely
interested in AI, Machine Learning, Image Processing, and Datamining, and have been supplementing the education I've received with free online courses from
Coursera and Udacity. I am also an active member of ACM, and have particpiated in two Intercollegiate Programming Competitions, as well
as the NYU Poly  Cyber Security Awareness Week Capture the Flag, Google Codejam, and IBM's Master the Mainframe.

My studies keep me very busy, but I do manage to get some downtime in where I like to hit the beach, go diving with my father, play video games, or practice jujitsu. As my education comes to a close, it is unclear if I will be able to remain in this amazing place that has 
changed my life so much, but winning this competition would certainly be a step in the right direction.  

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
As I mentioned above, my main interests fall along the lines of AI, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Datamining, so I definitely plan to use my knowledge from at least one of these domains. I may take a whack at the real time communication theme, but being an educator myself, I may go in the direction of creating an interactive activity for first time software developers. API wise, I see a lot of interesting API's on
Mashape, and API Tools, so plan on seeing API's from at least one of these sites. Moreover, I'll probably use QUANDL if I find that I need a large dataset unless I find a suitable dataset elsewhere.

I began doing freelance web development in high school, and had become disenchanted with it by the time I reached
University.  However, after working some co-op positions with some passionate web developers, I gained a appreciation
and insight for what the web is capable of.

Now, I'm all about pushing the limits of what the web can do.  I like to think I have some creative and innovative
ideas to bring to the table, and I'm excited to be taking part in the first ever Global Hackathon.  One day, when events
like this are commonplace, I'll be able to look back and say that I was there for the beginning!


Skills and Direction
=======

My passion has always been in interactive media, anything that takes entertainment beyond something to be simply
consumed, allowing people to influence and engage with it.  I love experimenting with new web technologies to
break expectations regarding the limitations of the web.  My hope is to combine my passion with these
technologies in a result that is both practical and delightful for users.

I'm a self-taught coder who studied marketing in college. For the last 7 years I've been developing mobile and web apps and really enjoying it. Trying to grow and learn as much as I can.
I've been to two hackathons previously, one in Barcelona (my former home) and the other one in Berlin. Really like the vibe one gets in this kind of competitions and the growth attainable from seeing other peoples projects.


My skills
=======
I've worked server side with PHP and Python. Probably what I'll be doing for the hackathon will be more of a client side app, so JavaScript this time :)
For API's I'm interested in doing something with Wolfram Alpha and maybe Google Predictions (the whole interface looks interesting).
For the project I like the TOA/EULA theme.

# megusta

I'm Ivan and I just looooooove little software and hardware helpers that make life easier.
But sometimes little things overgrow to big ugly monster, so it's better to kill them than develop -__-.
I hope, this time I'll focus on one thing and won't use whole bucket of technologies
just for one simple purpose. :)

# What skills do I have?

Well, I'm kinda web developer with mixin of mobile developer who can speak following languages
(and speaks them in daily life):

 - PHP
 - golang
 - C# (Silverlight)
 - Javascript

My idea is to work on gathering and processing one kind of statistics that will serve well to 80%
of possible users. I'll focus on usability, because "usable" thing means "something that helps me
every day".

#This mikedamike
mikedamike is focussed on delivering fast and useful code

#About the team
Mike is the core of this team and others float in and out of it from time to time.
Mike is a technofile: he loves learning, teaching and living code, gadgets and all things technical.

What makes mikedamike unique is the approach taken: The pursute of fast and useful code. Many may code more quickly or in a more targetted manner. But there is or should be more to coding than the fewest commands or the least time to delivery.

Coding (or should I say Koding??) for mikedamike is about finding both fast and useful through learning. This learning is not just the pursute of coding technics or new ideas. Though both are great, neither really touches the core issue.

Software is for people. To write a truly great program, you must walk the proverbial mile in the users shoes and make them not only what they ask for or even only what they need, but dare to dream their dreams and deliver what they will want before they even know they want it. Dare to experience things through their eyes and hands and hearts.

Its already late if we deliver after they feel the need. And so, that is the basis of the 'Fast and Useful'. Not an attempt to just make money, or even a name, but an attempt to help others, by knowing them better.

#mikedamike's skills
Really there just isn't much that mikedamike doesn't have for skills in the tech world.

This will be updated soon with more detailes.

#About this singleton

###Who, me?
I am Prajogo Tio, an (computer) engineering student from *Nanyang Technological University*, Year 2.
I have just started learning about programming more or less 11 months (I started learning in December 2013).
Since then I've been hooked by the computing world and wanted to gain ever more awesome experience.
I might be very green and incompetent (I admit it) but I believe I have to start somewhere.
That is my main motivation in participating in this Hackathon, and hopefully I might have the chance to compete.

###Interests
I've enjoyed programming several HTML5 Games using mainly Javascript and Canvas. 
Two main games I've written so far are:
  1. A 2D side scrolling spaceship game to test out prototypal inheritence in JS. [view](http://prajogotio.github.io/Space/Space.html)
  2. Another one is 2.5D FPS game (I call it BOOM) based on Raycasting principles to emulate 3D in 2D engine. Pretty fun! [view](http://prajogotio.github.io/boom/boom.html)
You may want to check out my Github IO page to test them:
[prajogotio.github.io](prajogotio.github.io)

I'm also actively participating in algorithm contests just to keep my mind in check. I love learning and I will never stop.
I do keep a log on what I've learnt in my blogspot: [abitofcs.blogspot.sg](abitofcs.blogspot.sg)

###Hopes
I am looking for a chance to strengthen my foundation in code design and planning. I hope I get a chance to learn from this Hackathon.

Thank you for taking your time to read this page.

Regards,
   Prajogo Tio

###UPDATE: Another Member!

###Knock, knock, who's there?
He is Andhieka Putra, an enthusiastic Year 2 Computer Science undergraduate from National University of Singapore. Github: [github.com/andhieka](https://github.com/andhieka)

We love finding creative solutions to problems people don't think about, whether it's maps, reporting, Wordpress Security or interesting methodologies to save our code from ourselves. We're up to the challenge of finding out how to do it with as much caffeine and as little tears as possible and as beautifully as possible.

Our Skills:
=======

Samantha is a front end designer with a lot of security experience and is great at bothering companies with bad documentation on twitter, she loves to use new APIs and harp on everyone about open sourcing code. Samantha is great with Linux but not so great when Windows breaks.

Expertise: Javascript, CSS3, HTML5, PHP, ASCII art in email invites.

Billy is a back end unicorn who makes everyone's life easier with a deployment system that actually works. He sits in the far corner typing code and sending people dog gifs. Billy loves long projects with no foreseeable end and Laravel.

Expertise: PHP, MySQL, Laravel, Javascript, DevOps

Beyonce is the jack of all trades with the best album to ever drop in 2014. She is great at front end development and design, including the dreaded email templates. She's a perfectionist for all the little tweaks with the patience of a saint. Beyonce has good musical taste, but doesn't always like it when people use inline styles.

Expertise: Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, Wordpress, email templates that actually work.

Michael the Younger is the optimist in all things, still a beginner, he has proven himself to be a quick learner in all things web. He knows how to work with Google SEO which is more than most people can say. Usually the clean up crew on large projects, he gets all of the small things other devs miss.

Expertise: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Quality Assurance, SEO magic

Lauren is the coolest person on our team with optimism and great design in all parts of her life, she is great at managing and making the web beautiful. A project manager and a photographer makes her skills a wide swath of the project, but when it comes down to the wire she can produce gorgeous UIs that make Jony Ives cry.

Expertise: Project Management, UI/UX, Wireframes, reassuring devs that it's not the end times.

What we're doing:
=======

Legalese is usually in 5pt font at the bottom of the page that no one ever reads, but in the end, if you're caught doing something you're not supposed to with sites, images and privacy, that stuff you scrolled past a million times becomes important.

We believe the first step to usability is good design and gamification. By adding badges and rating scales to legal documents, any lawyer, or site can put it through a generator and get a gorgeous result that is both interactive and easy to understand with badges giving you a quick rundown of what you're agreeing to, and highlighted areas translated into something we can all understand without the student loan debt that comes from law school.

My name is Philip Tolton. I'm a software developer.

I recently built a startup called DishGo. I built incredible software for over a year. We made some money and my software was used by thousands of people. I'm now looking for my next challenge.

I've used Rails, Objective-C, Linux, Javascript, MongoDB, Mysql and much much more. I'm building a custom router out of a Banana Pi right now. It's running Arch Linux.

I have some free time and a buddy suggested I sign up for this. I'm going to build something really cool.

I think I'm going to use some OCR technology and integrate it into Quickbooks. There were some things I was forced to do for DishGo when it was time to do our taxes that were really painful. I think they can be automated.

# Team revolTOS

We are Federico, Paulo, Carlos, Eduardo and Rita, and we can basically can fix from a radio to a CT scanner, we can design circuits with logic gates, with PICs, with microprocessors and even micro-controllers. We used to mention the languages we know how to code with... Lately it's easier to say that Ruby on rails and Python are not our thing, but we can even code in ancient mayan!

Besides that, with Eduardo we complement our coding skills with artistic design, which makes our creation a real piece of art. Carlos provides the business insights to make revolTOS an always market-oriented/market-driven group. Paulo and Rita design our products in such a way that the user experience goes as a charm. And Federico builds the backend to make sure our products are meaningful.


Carlos Boto

Since an early age I have been fascinated by the idea of creating economic value through disruptive
technologies and by the impact of such projects in society. I work on technology transfer projects, product
identification, market analysis, finding strategies to market entry and financial analysis. I dream about the
day where the interface between Research / Business / Finance disappears, contributing this way to
global development.


Federico Cismondi

I think of myself as a “data-driven person”, somebody who likes to dig deeply into collected information
and then look for the facts in order to make decisions based on them. Also, since the early stages of my
career I have had a self-driven, self-motivated way of encompassing work in multidisciplinary
environments, sometimes having limited or no supervision at all, and still achieving or surpassing the
expected goals.


Paulo Melo

I think of myself as an engineering artist. I understand how people interact with problems, interfaces and
situations, and creatively define structures to facilitate those interactions. I have multidisciplinary
experience in design and product development to successfully guide the product to market.

I'm a scientist (mainly with climate-related subjects) who has been writing code for research and 
outreach for many years. I am interested in numerical modeling and visualizations that help
make sense of the world in beautiful ways. 



Why I want to win
===================================
I have an idea about how to create more beautiful and interactive visualizations of global climate fields 
(like surface temperature) and I want to bring that idea into production for a large audience 
so they can see for themselves how the global climate has behaved, and that they can play with the data to draw their own conclusions from data.

Skills
============== 
- Javascript 
- HTML5 
- SVG 
- sed/awk/shell scripts etc
- NOAA/NASA APIs for the data

The idea
=======             
I'm going to tackle the climate question...by developing a better way to present public datasetes from 
NOAA and NASA.

##The Wunderbruders!


###About our team

We are two brothers originally from Brazil, but now both living in different parts of Germany. 
Our love for games brought us across the ocean to work in the digital games industry!

#### Ziro Neto
<img width="100" height="100" src='https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mMy0f7dYdvQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD4/9EVCYnFPgt0/photo.jpg' alt='Ziro'/>


_Game Artist, Salsa Dancer, Latin Lover._


Starting in Brazil he has been exploring the world of game graphics in search of new exciting challenges.

His new quest brought him to work at MegaZebra in Munich, after having lived and worked in Recife, Helsinki, Berlin and Paris.
His amazing graphical skills will bring beauty to the project

#### Edgar Neto

_Programming Nerd, Coffee Drinker, Sleepy Dad._


Also from Recife, Brazil this guy made his way to Berlin to start a new life with new challenges in the Old World.
Unlike his brother, he decided to set foot and stay in just one place.

He now works as an Objective-C developer at Memorado, making Brain Training games, but his hobby is to code Javascript and get other people excited about programming.

#### The Project
We will be tackling the "Game to teach beginners how to code" category. If all goes well, we will continue the project after the Hackathon with the intent to make it an official [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com/) tutorial.
