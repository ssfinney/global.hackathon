Hi.
================

We are a group of awesome humans from Waterloo, Ontario who believes the world can be taken over, one line of code at a time. We believe in a world where binary and biology are seamlessly integrated. We'd call ourselves and all our fellow programmers alike the abode of peace between man and machine, if not for the fact that we all contribute the the singularity, which will render us irrelevent to history sometimes this century.
