APPetizers Put You in a Good Mood
================

We are the APPetizers. We build apps, in competitions!   Need we say more?  Probably! (and that's what the section below is for)


Our Dreams
===========================
It's our vision that apps be more than websites - we want to bring about real change with our code.

Our side project is something we believe could change everything political, EasyBallot.org.  We want to bring about political awareness in the US and other democratic countries.  I (Shawn) plan to dedicate all of my winnings to supporting the efforts of EasyBallot.org and help educate voters using their representative's previous voting history.

With time and enough data we can educate the public on gerrymandering, create political blacklists (to highlight the politicians that actually do not reprepresent their voters), and do so much more.

Our team is comprised of developers from National Instruments in Austin, TX.  

Skillz and Amazing Tools
=======
Half of our time at work is spent learning about new tools, and I believe the other half is probably coding.  So while we have a smorgasborg of info and tools in our repertoire, we tend to use what we believe is best for the job.

From our github accounts, we are all fairly well versed in javascript.

I know that with web app development, that's a bit like telling kids that we use snow for our snowmen, but our snowmen can file your taxes, walk the dog, and pick up the kids from daycare.  The rest is just good ideas and some guys having fun coding!
