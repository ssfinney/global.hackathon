#About me
Hello! I'm **Alfio Missaglia**, a  thirteen years old computer science student who lives in Venice, Italy.
I own the [www.missaglialfio.pw](https://www.missaglialfio.pw/) blog :)

#My project
My project'll be based on the first and the fourth themes.
So, I'll make a creative and interactive lesson platform, with games developed probably in Node.js and jQuery.
I'll also try to learn Python's basics before Hackathon start, I think I can make nice things with it :D

#Skills
I do have experience with those programming languages:
* Java
* PHP
* jQuery
* CSS
* JavaScript
* SQL - [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) and [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
* HTML5
* Node.js
* Ruby - Using [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) webserver
* A **veeeeery** little bit of Python

I also know the basics of Photoshop and GIMP.

#Infos
I think I'll participate in the Hackathon as an individual, but I'm not sure C:
Feel free to send me an email (`public [AT] missaglialfio [DOT] pw`) if you're interested in me.
