Canik
================

This is my first hackathon and I have entered as a solo participant. 
I want a challenge. I want to create a software about a real world problem in 48 hours and I want to see what everybody else did.



My programming skills
=======
I am proficient in Java. I developed enterprise web applications with Primefaces. It is irrelevant in this event but I have 5 year experience with Android development.


I am planning to do something on Tomcat. I checked and it worked on koding.com vpn.
