Even though technology has evolved so much in the last 15 years, there are many solutions for problems we face everyday that date decades ago.
Problems that we are "just used to" or that "we can't help but do what everybody else is doing". 
It's time to change that!

We aim for the unthought. We want to redesign solutions for **language learning**.
