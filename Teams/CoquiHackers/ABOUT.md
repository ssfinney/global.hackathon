# Coqui Hackers

Here to learn new things, brainstorm ideas and put them to work in the real life.

## About Me

My name is Jesiniel. I live in Puerto Rico. I am currently a student at UPRM where I study Computer Engineering. I have worked with C and Java languages during my current studies. I have little knowledge in HTML and CSS, hoping this gets me somewhere in this hackathon. I am looking forward in learning other languages. I have interest in Javascript, Python and PHP.

## Languages I love

- Java
- C
