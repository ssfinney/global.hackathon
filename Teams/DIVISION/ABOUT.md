##About me
I'm Philip Rego Morato, 18 years old, from Davao City, Philippines. I'm just a newbie and I want to learn more by participating in this Global Hackathon. I know that the chance of me winning this competition is very low, but still I am determined to code with my best.

I took computer classes during my High School years. Through edX, I was able to study Computer Science 50, an online course by Harvard. Now I'm able to program with C and the basics of HTML, JavaScript and CSS. I have no plans yet but I will make sure that I will have before the Hackathon starts.
