Tell us who you are, why you did you decide to join?
==============

We are three full time developers working for past few years in a budding start-up in Mumbai. All three of us work 
most of time in different web development related technologies like PHP, Javascript and related Frameworks. When not 
busy working we like to spend time playing games like UNO and Bluff

We decided to join Koding Global Hackathon because of followig reasons:
* To use our skills to plan, design and ulitmate code something useful in constrained time; that too as team.
* To dabble with atleast one latest technology and know more about Koding cloud development platform itself.
* For Fun and Profit [:P](http://cecs.wright.edu/~tkprasad/courses/cs781/alephOne.html)

=============

We are still in planning for what we are going to do. To be updated soon.
