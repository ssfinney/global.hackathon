Fluffle

Welcome to the Fluffle team page  :)


Team Fluffle (single person)
============================

Hello, my name is Kris and I'm a software engineer from Minneapolis, MN. 
Most of the work I've done in "the Industry"  has been data related ... 
data warehousing big data. Though I've worked in a variety of programming
languages, and have a deep understanding of data, I've rarely had the
opportunity to really explore front-end work and develop something really
slick that just begs to be used, clicked, played with.


Skills
=======
Data: Databases (Oracle, Informix, MySql), ETL: Ab Initio 

Programming: PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, C, C++

Plan
====
I've not yet picked my challenge, though I'll likely go with the HTML5 games 
challenge. Working through making a multiplayer, interactive, educational
experience would be an interestin challenge.

Tools I'd Use
=============
Not set in stone but I've been wanting to play with Phaser 2.0, so I'd likely 
start with that and add as necessary.
