We are already working hard for some time on a project, 
this hackaton is the opportunity to gain money and the visibility we need to become this dream a reality .

It is also a good showcase for us to show how good we are at what we do .


Yes we have a lot of skills!
=======
We are good with nodejs , javascript , java and groovy , but we have a little weak to develop layouts.


The project
=======
We love Retrogames and we know how much we can learn while you play, so our project will follow this path, 
a great game to teach future great minds how to create great software.
