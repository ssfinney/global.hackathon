We took part in a Hackathon during the ICT Days when we were both enrolled in the first year of Computer Science degree.
We both enjoied the experience and we found in this hackathon the opportunity to have fun again.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
Nicolò makes html5 games using Haxe in his free time and would like to bring his skills in this hackathon.

Patrick enjoys programming android applications, he loves all things that pertaining to the world of computers.

We still have to decide the details of our project though.
