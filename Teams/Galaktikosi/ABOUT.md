"I am a very passionate person. I get excited over small things. And coding is my huge passion. 
I love the world of numbers, where creativity and imagination can do whatever we want. I just 
command the directions.. and the code.. It gets in right place. All of us can do this. You just have to know 
the secret in imagination. ;)

The tools that help me express my ideas: 
.NET,
C#, C++, C, Python, Javascript, HTML5,
ASP .NET MVC 5, Web API, Entity Framework, Google Map Web API, CSS..

I love doing magic with my team. We go off the Earth very often together and this time stars are our destination."

I have experience working in different programming environments, and operation systems, worked with teams in virtual and now working in live, and I am learning more and more every day and willing to participate in many events to gain knowledge.

"Running through the Space is joyful experience, stars are so peaceful and lively at the same time, and you can always run into something unexpected. Why am I the First Officer? Co-working with captain and the crew makes me see things from a different perspective and makes me capable to make things work.  When I'm on the Earth I live at Sarajevo where I go to college. 

What do I know? C#, C++, .NET, ASP.NET MVC5, Entity Framework, Java, Javascript, HTML, ...

And most of all, I like object oriented design because it lets me be creative, makes me use my knowledge and helps me in solving plenty of new tricky problems. Beside OOD, things that attract me are algorithm design and teamwork too."

"I'm just a young soul being fascinated over and over again by the way that simple combinations of ones and zeros can produce the most amazing designs and functionalities. Java, C, PHP, HTML.. Makes no difference to me. It is all good. I can take over the helm and take us anywhere, no matter what."
