Tell us who you are, why you did you decide to join?
=======
We are three developpers each from different country.
No one knew the other before this big challenge opportunity :)
Gathred by the fact that we are all willing to try out new things that require short deadlines, so we thought this hackathon would be that next great challenge.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

We are front-end developers and are therefore going to experiement on a new multiplayer educational game. We will be using:

- Ember.js on the front-end
- PubNub for realtime messaging
- Node.js for the server
- Nginx
