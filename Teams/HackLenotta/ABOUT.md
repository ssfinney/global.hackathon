We are three friends, **Edoardo Odorico (edoardoo)**,  **Lorenzo Farnararo (baldarn)**  and **Sanjeya Cooray (Sanje)** from Florence, Italy. We all studied engineer. While we were studying Edo and Lorenzo joined our University Open Source Software Lab, LILiK, where they developed their coding and unix skills, and some free software philosophy. 
Together with other **LILiK** members they began to meet together at Edoardoo's house, in hacking sessions during the weekends. This is where they thought at first one of their success projects: turning lights on and off with an arduino, a raspberry, a pinch of javascript and a lot of hacking nights (usually with some wine, don't forget we're italian). Since we wanted to share our hard and funny work with the rest of the world, we've built a blog/tutorial about our hacking projects, hack.lenotta.com. We mainly hack on arduino, raspberry, antennas, HTML5, Javascript and CSS3. 
Lorenzo met Sanje while working together in a software house and we all knew from the very beginning he was the right full stack developer we were missing.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
We're skilled on both frontend and backend development. We'll probably use baaskets of javacript (perhaps for the server side too, why not?) and we would like to bleach the mess of EULA and TOS around, compress it, colour it and... you'll see (me heheheh)...
Update (1/12/2014): maybe some changes in plans? maybe some multimedia stuff? Something is boiling under the plate...
