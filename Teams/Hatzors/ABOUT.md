Team Hatzors!
=============

We are three grade 10 students in Canada, looking to see what we can do here. Together we are quite fluent in `HTML`/`CSS`/`JS`, `Python`, and are learning `Swift` and dabbling in lots of other languages. We've got about 15 years of code experience between the three of us.

We are:

### Eden S.-G.

I mainly work on front-ends, usually in `HTML`/`CSS`/`JS`. I also dabble in Blender, Inkscape and GIMP for design work. I put some of my web work [here](http://edensg.me/), and I have a bunch of design/visuals [here](http://edensg.me/files.html#files%2Fimagesl) and [here](https://edensg.github.io/#page-nav-CGI) (haven’t updated this last page in a while). I’ve been exploring Jekyll and `SASS`, and have been using tools like Node.JS and `Ruby` for a while now.

I was introduced to coding in grade four by an awesome teacher I had — he had a bunch of Commodore 64s in the classroom and taught the entire class the basics of `BASIC`. I ended up making text-based adventures, lottery/probability games, and even a conversation engine (it didn’t say much, but it did work). The next year I made a full game of Asteroids in Scratch, complete with X, Y and rotational momentum and acceleration, and asteroid splitting. I since have taught myself `HTML`/`CSS`/`JS` through Codecademy, and have started making an online version of [Vector 3](https://web.archive.org/web/20131115042508/http://playthisthing.com/vector-3) with Three.JS. I have contributed code for Fight For the Future, have made interactive online infographics for school projects, and have attended a local hackathon for Global Hack Day where I set up a Pi to run as a transparent Tor proxy.

I am 15 years old, and have been programming since I was 11. I have been taught Java 8 and Python 3 at school, but have pursued many other languages on my own time, including `C`, `C++`, `Objective-C`, and `Swift`, plus a few scripting languages, such as `Bash`, `Perl`, and `Ruby`. I got into scripting because I wanted to automate things that I did repeatedly, and that opened up doors to learning higher-level languages, rather than just scripting.

I am also very interested in Bitcoin. I have been mining Bitcoin since May of this year, and I’ve made about 0.4 BTC (about 168 CAD as of the time of writing). I think that cryptocurrencies will be used a lot in the future — Cryptocurrencies cannot be controlled by any central agency, so the value of the currency cannot be manipulated by the government to fit their own needs. Also, since they can easily be sent to anyone in the world no matter where they are, there would no longer be a need for currency exchange fees/inconvenience of exchanging currencies.

I have also been running a Tor relay, an I2P node, and a Freenet node (with 50GB of cache), contributing to three of the leading networks that protect privacy and anonymity online.

### Taj Dyson

Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. 

I'm Taj, and I have had the illusion of consciousness for 15 years.

I code regularly, mostly in `Python`. I like object-based stuff.
Right now I am working on the soft/firmware of a wrist thingy/smartwatch with a Raspberry Pi. Some recent projects include an Arduino-controlled laser-prompted light switch, programmed, of course, with the Arduino IDE, and a food distribution simulator written in `Python` that has an AI that decides what to spend resources on.
Some dabbling has also been done into `HTML`, `Javascript`, and `BASIC` (where I started, in grade 5, with Eden).
Most of this has been self taught through the powers of the internet, with no school input.
I like to do things as simply and as straightforward as possible, favoring understandability over fanciness, and if anything gets too complex or nested, I tend to start over from a previous patch.
I also really like my hat.

## The plan...
*{insert maniacal evil laughter}*

We plan on recreating a three-dimensional space board game with ThreeJS and HTML5 Canvas for the browser. The game is based on strategy — there are many things to keep track of — and there are spaceships. Come on, who doesn't like spaceships? *Pew! Pew!* ***Kablooie!***

The game is turn-based, and involves acceleration, momentum and maybe even orientation in 3D space (or even 4D, if we get around to it). As you play the game, you will learn about calculating distances in multi-dimensional space, probability, falloff, and preemptive action.

### What we've got so far:
