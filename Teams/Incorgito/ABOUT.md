Incorgito is composed of Mark Steve Samson and Beato Bongco from the Philippines. We took one look at the hackthon themes and decided to join. You had us at educational HTML5 games.

We work at [Insync](https://insynchq.com) doing web development, but the only reason we really even dipped our toes into the world of programming was to try and make games. As with many things in life, you often end up doing something else entirely than what you set out to do. As time passed, the world of application and web development consumed us. But the urge to develop a game has always burned at the back of our minds and will probably never leave us. When we read the topic list on koding.com, we immediately saw the opportunity to combine two things we love: making games and teaching others how to program.

We want to win this hackathon because it will validate our that voice at the back of our heads. We want to win because we believe programming is an essential skill in the world today, and we want to be the ones that help spread the fire.

We are Incorgito. Expect us.
