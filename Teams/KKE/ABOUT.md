### Hi there!

We're [`KKE`](http://matome-lab.com/samviewrs2.php?murl=uggc%3A%2F%2Fyvirqbbe.oybtvzt.wc%2Fnxo48zngbzrybt%2Fvztf%2Fn%2F4%2Fn42474po.wct&mtr=uggc%3A%2F%2Ffxr48zngbzr.arg%2Fnepuvirf%2F39124489.ugzy).
Both of us are from [South Korea](http://www.google.co.uk/#q=South+Korea) and students of [Yonsei University](http://www.yonsei.ac.kr/eng/). We specialise in failing to find a web designer and are keen on $8,000.

### Hi, I'm Alex.

I'm a developer, currently staying in Oxford.
I usually write [code](https://github.com/noraesae) in JavaScript and
Scala, sometimes in Python and Go as well. I'm also keen to learn many
other new things. I love to read and [write](https://medium.com/@noraesae)
something. In my spare time, I like to sleep, [diarize](http://yuiazu.net),
cycle, listen to [music](http://noraesae.net/music), travel and take a
photo.

### Hi, I'm Yong-uk.

I'm a developer who barely write code these days cause I have no
interest in anything but [*LOVELIVE*](http://www.lovelive-anime.jp)
recently.
I have experience in C++(especially in WebKit), Obj-C, JavaScript,
Python, etc... Nothing's been left in my brain, though. But it's
okay. Google is always with me.

## What we're going to do

[We have come up with a truly marvellous idea for this hackathon which
this margin is too narrow to contain.

Sorry, but you will see in a while!
