TEAM KUALI
==========

The word *kuali* in Ancient Mayan means *beautiful or good* and we like how it resembles the English word for **Quality** and that is what we are building **Beautiful and Good quality Software**.


BTW The ancient mayans predicted we would win for sure, let us hope its not a fake prediction like the apocalypse.



The **Awesome** star developers:


1. Rodrigo a Computer Science major, knows a lot about **Mathematics** **Statistics** and **Software Engineering**


2. Andrew an expert in Java and Functional test.He will make sure nothing goes past QA without being debugged.


3. Shawon is the UX and Graphics Designer. The interface will never look as stunning and jaw-dropping without his expertise.
4. Rommel Esparcia is a full stack developer (Node, angular, express, mongo) expert in sailsjs and hapijs with expertise in both frontend and backend.
