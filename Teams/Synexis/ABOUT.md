## About Me

Greetings Koding Hackathon Judges,

I can not express in words how grateful I would be for the opportunity to compete in the first global hackathon. Several years ago I participated as an individual in NASA's ISS challenge (to develop an algorithm to improve solar panel efficiency during low-light orbits). Although my results ranked in the top 1% of entries, I lost my internet connection at the deadline and was not able submit my solution. I have since been waiting for a competition to redeem myself, and this seems like the perfect fit.

I have been fascinated with computers since I was four years old, and have been coding in various languages for over 20 years with an emphasis in web development. While I have a vast general knowledge of modern technology in general, my areas of expertise are primarily related to LAMP, HTML5/CSS3, Javascript/jQuery, and ImageMagick, but I also have extensive experience in many other areas.

Since 2008 I have worked as a self-employed developer and information systems consultant. I've developed for a number of companies and individuals, including CCPensieve, The Daily Cafe and 360start.com. For the past two years I have contracted primarily for Idexx Laboratories, Inc. as the lead developer on several internal-use applications. My long-term goal in life is to develop free-use solutions using technology (in the same sense as Wikipedia).

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to see you again on the 6th and 7th!

Sincerely,
M. Murphy
