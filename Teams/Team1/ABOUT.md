Programming as an art


About your team
===========================

My name is Sergey Parkhomenko. I'm first year student and i decided to do my best and prove to all and firstly to myself that I'm the best in my area. 


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

My main technologies are:

Python, Django, Javascript, AngularJS

But my choice always strongly depends on task.

I strongly believe that every line of code written by programmer is art and I am going to prove it on this competition.
