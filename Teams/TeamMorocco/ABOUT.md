I'm the Team Morocco :) I think I'm the only representative of my country (hope there's more ;)).


About the team
===========================

I'm a computer science engineer, I have more than 8 years professional 
experience, but my story with programming has started before graduating.

13 years ago, I have had my first scientific calculator (it's was an HP-48GX)
I was very happy with it and two year after that (I didn't have a computer at 
that time) I have made my first program and it's was my own version of the 
snake game (to be honest it wasn't fully functional :) but I could play with it).

About my skills
=======
Now I'm a java architect with some Oracle Professional Certifications, I can
work with: Java & JEE + frameworks, PHP, JavaScript (Backbone, Angular ...), SQL,
HTML, CSS ... the list is very long :)
