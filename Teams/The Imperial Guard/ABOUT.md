About the team

The objective is to hone my skills by doing service to the community by doing the only thing I can do: ___code___.


Skills
======

I'm a Python lover, specially for the making of web applications. I love Flask, and will use it whenever I can over anything else. I'm also a Desktop developer fanboy and use PySide for anything that's not web. Good at JavaScript, if that's something.
