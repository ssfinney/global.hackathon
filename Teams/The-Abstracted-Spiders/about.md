About the Team:
---------------

Our three member team consists of game development champion Dipen, web and backend guru Parth and jack of all trades Anuj.

What's unique about this team is that each member prefers a different language than the rest of the team members. Dipen prefers C#, Parth prefers JS and Anuj prefers Python. While we'll probably end up spending countless hours arguing the benefits of different languages and frameworks, we do have one saving grace. All three of us speak three of same spoken languages- English, Gujarati and Hindi. At least we'll be able to carry out the argument without having to resort to non-verbal tactics :P.


What we're going to build:
--------------------------

Of the themes mentioned in the contest rules, one theme that resonated between all three of us is the idea of introducing software development to beginners through games. We all feel like software development would have been much more exciting if our first few tutorials had been related to game development. We believe that this would have fueled our curiosity and given us enough intrinsic motivation to go ahead and experiment with the language, the product and the environment. We hope that we can create such a product during this hackathon, and possibly even continue building it past the prototype stage and into production.
