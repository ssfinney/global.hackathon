We are team of experienced web developers working together in the same company.

#What we are going to use

 - Ruby and Ruby on Rails
 - JavaScript, Backbone.js and probably some other cool libs
 - HTML and CSS of course ;)
 - MySQL or maybe MongoDB

#Some words about our idea

We are going to create a web application somehow related to online education ([MOOC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course))
