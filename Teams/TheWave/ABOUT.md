About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
We use a lot of open source projects to help us build things faster. We love simple things and of course, Python.
Also, for web developments we prefer Django and Flask. But have tested dozens of other frameworks for web development. In fact, we still mantain a few Php apps right now.
Building apps is our life and we enjoy it very much, we are confident that this is going to stand out in our final product.

More updates comming... :)
