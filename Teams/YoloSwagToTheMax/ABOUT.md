## Hi, I'm Jeremy.
### I'm a recent college graduate of the University of California, San Diego. I'm taking some time off before I start working, and I'm using this time to do things that I didn't have too much time for in college. Some of these things include working on my own projects, playing more guitar, writing, and reading more books.

### I decided to join the Koding Global Hackathon because I love making things, and this is just another opportunity to do so.

## What am I doing?
### I'm not sure yet, but it's probably going to be something related to my passion of enabling others to pursue their passions. I've done a lot of STEM outreach back in college, so maybe I'll create a game. I'll update this later.
