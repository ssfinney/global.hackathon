###Welcome to darapti!


###About me
P. Coleman.
* College student
* Philosophy major
* Formal logic geek
* Solo novice developer


###What in the world's a darapti?
<p>Darapti is one of the valid categorical syllogisms in formal logic, as constructed by Aristotle.</p>
<p>A syllogism is an argument consisting of two or more premises and a conclusion. It uses deductive reasoning to arrive at the conclusion from the premises.</p>
<p>There are 256 possible syllogisms, but only ~20 valid forms.
However, Aristotle's system proved hard to memorize alone (too many darn vowels), so the medievals created mnemonics for the valid forms.
Darapti is one of them.</p>
(paraphrased from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism))


###Darapti as a syllogism: 
```
Premise: All hackathons are fun events.
Premise: All hackathons are strenuous events.
Conclusion: So, some strenuous events are fun events.
```

###Why darapti?
1. Darapti is a weakened form. For the conclusion to be true, it must assume that the terms in the premises are.</p>
2. It's a reminder for me to check all parts of my program and make sure they function. Otherwise, just like an argument, it'll fall apart.</p>
3. Logic is how I gained the confidence to code.
4. Darapti also rolls off the tongue well (dah-rahp-tee).</p>

###Why hackathon?
1. Why not?
2. I've been sitting on my butt with some ideas, but haven't been inspired to build them yet.
3. I like the opportunity to try to build something in a limited time frame.


###Skillset and Ambitions
* a cup of PHP/MySQL
* a pinch of JavaScript
* a dash of HTML/CSS
* I'll create either an educational game or something to help with the fine print.
* Not sure of specific APIs at the moment.
