#This mikedamike
mikedamike is focussed on delivering fast and useful code

#About the team
Mike is the core of this team and others float in and out of it from time to time.
Mike is a technofile: he loves learning, teaching and living code, gadgets and all things technical.

What makes mikedamike unique is the approach taken: The pursute of fast and useful code. Many may code more quickly or in a more targetted manner. But there is or should be more to coding than the fewest commands or the least time to delivery.

Coding (or should I say Koding??) for mikedamike is about finding both fast and useful through learning. This learning is not just the pursute of coding technics or new ideas. Though both are great, neither really touches the core issue.

Software is for people. To write a truly great program, you must walk the proverbial mile in the users shoes and make them not only what they ask for or even only what they need, but dare to dream their dreams and deliver what they will want before they even know they want it. Dare to experience things through their eyes and hands and hearts.

Its already late if we deliver after they feel the need. And so, that is the basis of the 'Fast and Useful'. Not an attempt to just make money, or even a name, but an attempt to help others, by knowing them better.
