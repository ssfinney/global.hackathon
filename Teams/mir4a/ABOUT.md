I believe this hackathon will push new ideas to my mind and help me get things done. 
I think this is a good starting point for creating your own app from scratch.
And, hey, who knows, maybe this time it will find theirs users.


The Project
=======
I want to implement something helpful and distraction free tool for daily usage. 

Something that you can setup for your needs.
 
I'd like to use AngularJS and MongoDB with simple NodeJS server.
