#About this singleton

###Who, me?
I am Prajogo Tio, an (computer) engineering student from *Nanyang Technological University*, Year 2.
I have just started learning about programming more or less 11 months (I started learning in December 2013).
Since then I've been hooked by the computing world and wanted to gain ever more awesome experience.
I might be very green and incompetent (I admit it) but I believe I have to start somewhere.
That is my main motivation in participating in this Hackathon, and hopefully I might have the chance to compete.

###Interests
I've enjoyed programming several HTML5 Games using mainly Javascript and Canvas. 
Two main games I've written so far are:
  1. A 2D side scrolling spaceship game to test out prototypal inheritence in JS. [view](http://prajogotio.github.io/Space/Space.html)
  2. Another one is 2.5D FPS game (I call it BOOM) based on Raycasting principles to emulate 3D in 2D engine. Pretty fun! [view](http://prajogotio.github.io/boom/boom.html)
You may want to check out my Github IO page to test them:
[prajogotio.github.io](prajogotio.github.io)

I'm also actively participating in algorithm contests just to keep my mind in check. I love learning and I will never stop.
I do keep a log on what I've learnt in my blogspot: [abitofcs.blogspot.sg](abitofcs.blogspot.sg)

###Hopes
I am looking for a chance to strengthen my foundation in code design and planning. I hope I get a chance to learn from this Hackathon.

Thank you for taking your time to read this page.

Regards,
   Prajogo Tio
