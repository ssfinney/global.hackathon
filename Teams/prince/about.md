Who we are: 

We're a team of developers for Lucid Agency in Tempe, and we are always up for new challenges regarding web technologies. We love finding creative solutions to problems people don't think about, whether it's maps, reporting, Wordpress Security or interesting methodologies to save our code from ourselves. We're up to the challenge of finding out how to do it with as much caffeine and as little tears as possible and as beautifully as possible.

Our Skills:
=======

Samantha is a front end designer with a lot of security experience and is great at bothering companies with bad documentation on twitter, she loves to use new APIs and harp on everyone about open sourcing code. Samantha is great with Linux but not so great when Windows breaks.

Expertise: Javascript, CSS3, HTML5, PHP, ASCII art in email invites.

Billy is a back end unicorn who makes everyone's life easier with a deployment system that actually works. He sits in the far corner typing code and sending people dog gifs. Billy loves long projects with no foreseeable end and Laravel.

Expertise: PHP, MySQL, Laravel, Javascript, DevOps

Beyonce is the jack of all trades with the best album to ever drop in 2014. She is great at front end development and design, including the dreaded email templates. She's a perfectionist for all the little tweaks with the patience of a saint. Beyonce has good musical taste, but doesn't always like it when people use inline styles.

Expertise: Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, Wordpress, email templates that actually work.

Michael the Younger is the optimist in all things, still a beginner, he has proven himself to be a quick learner in all things web. He knows how to work with Google SEO which is more than most people can say. Usually the clean up crew on large projects, he gets all of the small things other devs miss.

Expertise: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Quality Assurance, SEO magic

Lauren is the coolest person on our team with optimism and great design in all parts of her life, she is great at managing and making the web beautiful. A project manager and a photographer makes her skills a wide swath of the project, but when it comes down to the wire she can produce gorgeous UIs that make Jony Ives cry.

Expertise: Project Management, UI/UX, Wireframes, reassuring devs that it's not the end times.

What we're doing:
=======

Legalese is usually in 5pt font at the bottom of the page that no one ever reads, but in the end, if you're caught doing something you're not supposed to with sites, images and privacy, that stuff you scrolled past a million times becomes important.

We believe the first step to usability is good design and gamification. By adding badges and rating scales to legal documents, any lawyer, or site can put it through a generator and get a gorgeous result that is both interactive and easy to understand with badges giving you a quick rundown of what you're agreeing to, and highlighted areas translated into something we can all understand without the student loan debt that comes from law school.
