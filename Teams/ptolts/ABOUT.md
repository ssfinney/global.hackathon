My name is Philip Tolton. I'm a software developer.

I recently built a startup called DishGo. I built incredible software for over a year. We made some money and my software was used by thousands of people. I'm now looking for my next challenge.

I've used Rails, Objective-C, Linux, Javascript, MongoDB, Mysql and much much more. I'm building a custom router out of a Banana Pi right now. It's running Arch Linux.

I have some free time and a buddy suggested I sign up for this. I'm going to build something really cool.

I think I'm going to use some OCR technology and integrate it into Quickbooks. There were some things I was forced to do for DishGo when it was time to do our taxes that were really painful. I think they can be automated.
